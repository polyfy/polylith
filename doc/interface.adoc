= Interface

Component interfaces give many benefits:

* _Consistency_. Components can only be accessed through their interface, making them easy to find, use, and reason about.

* _Encapsulation_. You can change a component's implementing namespaces without breaking the interface contract.

* _Composability_. All components have access to all other components via their interfaces, and you can replace them as long as they use the same interface.

When you created the `user` xref:component.adoc#create-component[component] as part of our xref:introduction.adoc[tutorial], `poly` also created the `user` interface.

So what is an `interface`, and what is it good for?

An interface in the Polylith world is a namespace named `interface` that usually lives in one, but sometimes several, sub-namespaces within a component.

Looking at our example `user` component, if you exclude the top namespace, in Polylith we think of its interface namespace as `user.interface`.

The interface defines `def`, `defn`, or `defmacro` statements which form the contract that it exposes to other components and bases.

== Declaring the Same Interface in Multiple Components

Let's pretend we have the interface namespace `user.interface` containing the functions `fun1` and `fun2` and that two components `user` and `admin` implement this interface, e.g,:

[source,text]
----
▾ myworkspace
  ...
  ▾ components
    ▾ user # <1>
      ▾ src
        ▾ com
          ▾ mycompany
            ▾ user # <2>
                interface.clj
                  fun1
                  fun2
                ...
    ▾ admin # <3>
      ▾ src
        ▾ com
          ▾ mycompany
            ▾ user # <4>
                interface.clj
                  fun1
                  fun2
                ...
  ...
----
<1> `user` component
<2> implements `user` interface
<3> `admin` component
<4> also implements `user` interface

Because we are free to edit the `interface.clj` file for both user and admin, they can get out of sync if we are not careful.
Luckily, the `poly` tool will help us keep them consistent and complain if they differ when we run the xref:commands.adoc#check[check], xref:commands.adoc#info[info] or xref:commands.adoc#test[test] commands:

[cols="25,25,50"]
|===
|Check |Example mismatch| To protect against

| Number of arguments
| `[a b]` +
`[a b c]`
| Incompatible signatures

| Argument order
| `[a b c]` +
`[b c a]`
| Accidental argument call order mismatches

| Type hints
| `[^String x y]` +
`[x y]`
| Incompatible types and type confusion

| Functions and macros
| `(defn foo [])` +
`(defmacro foo [])`
| Incompatible composability: functions are composable, and macros are not

|===

== Splitting an Interface into Sub-Namespaces

We often choose to have a single `interface` namespace in a component, but dividing the interface into several sub-namespaces is possible.
To do so, create an `interface` package (directory) with the name `interface` at the component root and then add the sub-namespaces.

You can find an example in Polylith itself, where the `util` component divides its https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/tree/master/components/util/src/polylith/clj/core/util/interface[interface] into several sub-namespaces:

[source,shell]
----
util
└── interface
    ├── color.clj
    ├── exception.clj
    ├── os.clj
    ├── str.clj
    └── time.clj
----

Dividing an interface like this can be handy to group and sub-group the interface functions.
One typical usage is to place https://clojure.org/about/spec[clojure specs] in its own `spec` sub-namespace.
You can see an example of this in the https://github.com/furkan3ayraktar/clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app[RealWorld example app], where the `article` component has both an `article.interface` and an https://github.com/furkan3ayraktar/clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app/blob/master/components/article/src/clojure/realworld/article/interface/spec.clj[`article.interface.spec`] sub-interface.

Here's an example of the sub-interface usage from the https://github.com/furkan3ayraktar/clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app/blob/master/bases/rest-api/src/clojure/realworld/rest_api/handler.clj[RealWorld example app handler] namespace in its `rest-api` xref:base.adoc[base]:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns clojure.realworld.rest-api.handler
  (:require ...
            [clojure.realworld.user.interface.spec :as user-spec]
            ...))

(defn login [req]
  (let [user (-> req :params :user)]
    (if (s/valid? user-spec/login user)
      (let [[ok? res] (user/login! user)]
        (handle (if ok? 200 404) res))
      (handle 422 {:errors {:body ["Invalid request body."]}}))))
----

TIP: Every time you are tempted to split up an interface into sub-namespaces, instead consider splitting the component into smaller components!

== Delegation

The most common way of structuring code in components is to delegate calls from the interface to one or more implementing namespaces.

There is one case where putting the implementation directly in the interface can be worth considering: if the functions are one-liners or tiny.
You can see an example of this in the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/components/path-finder/src/polylith/clj/core/path_finder/interface/criterias.clj[path-finder] component of the Polylith workspace.

Ultimately, it's up to you to do what you think is best.

Our experience has shown us many advantages to keeping interfaces tiny and having them only expose what is needed.

== Interface Definitions

So far, we have only used functions in the interface.
Polylith also supports having `def` and `defmacro` statements in the interface.
There is no magic here; just include the definitions you want, like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns se.example.logger.interface
  (:require [se.example.logger.core :as core]))

(defmacro info [& args]
  `(core/info ~args))
----

...which delegates to:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns se.example.logger.core
  (:require [taoensso.timbre :as timbre]))

(defmacro info [args]
  `(timbre/log! :info :p ~args))
----

== More About Interfaces

This list of tips makes more sense when you have used Polylith for a while, so bookmark this section for later:

* The interface docstrings should focus on what problem each function/macro solves, while the implementation docstrings can focus on concrete details.

* Consider sorting interface namespace functions in alphabetical order for easy lookup.
Order functions in implementation namespaces freely.

* The interface can expose the entity's name, e.g., `sell [car]`, while the implementing function can expose specific usage via destructuring, e.g., `sell [{:keys [model type color]}]`.

* It sometimes makes sense for a http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/functions.html#multi-arity-functions[multi-arity function] in an interface to delegate to a single arity function in the implementing namespace:
+
[source,clojure]
----
(defn foo
  ([a b c] (some-impl/foo a b c)
  ([a b] (foo a b nil)))
----

* It sometimes makes sense for a http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/functions.html#variadic-functions[variadic functions] in an interface to delegate to function in the implementing namespace that accepts the variadic portion as a vector:
+
[source,clojure]
----
(defn foo [a b & other]
  (some-impl/foo a b other))
----

* Polylith simplifies testing by allowing access to implementing namespaces from the `test` directory.
Polylith restricts the code under the `src` directory to only access the `interface` namespace.
The `poly` tool validates these restrictions when running the xref:commands.adoc#check[check], xref:commands#info[info], and xref:commands#test[test] command.

* Because Polylith only allows the code under `src` to call `interface` code, you can think of publicly declared implementation functions as protected (as in Java).
Because these "protected" functions are technically public, you can test and debug them more easily.
For example, when stopping at a breakpoint to evaluate a "protected" function, you don't need to use the special syntax you would need to access a private function.

* Polylith will always recognize `interface` and `ifc` as interface namespace names.
By default, it will generate code using `interface` as the interface namespace name when you create a component.
You can override this default via `:interface-ns` in `./workspace.edn`.
Scenarios:
** You want to share code between Clojure and ClojureScript via `.cljc` source files.
Since `interface` is a reserved word in ClojureScript, it will cause problems.
In this case, you can either:
*** set `:interface-ns` to `ifc`, `poly` will use `ifc` as the interface namespace name for generated code when you create a component
*** or leave `interface` as the default and override by specifying `interface:ifc` as an option to xref:commands.adoc#create-component[create component] for components that will also run from ClojureScript.
** You want to consume Clojure code from another language on the JVM, e.g., Kotlin, where `interface` is a reserved word.
You could set `:interface-ns` to anything that won't conflict, for the sake of this example, let's say `api`.
The `poly` tool would now use `api` for the interface namespace name when it generates code when you create a component, but also recognize `interface` and `ifc` as interface names.

= Configuration
:toc:

We have two categories of configuration:

1. Configuration used by the `poly` tool, stored in `workspace.edn` and `~/.config/polylith/config.edn`.
2. Configuration used by tools.deps, stored in `deps.edn` files in bricks and projects.

The content of all the configuration files also lives in the xref:workspace-structure.adoc[workspace structure], under these top keys:

[source,shell]
----
[:bases :components :projects :user :workspaces]
----

Let's go through each of them:

== workspaces

Today we always operate against one workspace at a time, but the plan is to support multiple workspaces in the future, see discussion https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/discussions/301[301].

The workspaces can be listed with:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:workspaces
----

[source,clojure]
----
[{:config { ... }
  :name "example"
  :type "workspace"}]
----

[%autowidth]
|===
| Key | Description

| `:config` | The content of `workspace.edn`.

| `:name` | The name of the workspace directory.

| `:type` | Set to "workspace".
|===

The workspace configuration file lives in `./workspace.edn`, and can be viewed with:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:workspaces:example
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:bricks {"user" {:ignore-files ["core.clj"]}}
 :compact-views #{}
 :default-profile-name "default"
 :interface-ns "interface"
 :projects {"command-line" {:alias "cl"}
            "development" {:alias "dev"}
            "user-service" {:alias "user-s"
                            :test {:create-test-runner my.test-runner/create}}}
 :tag-patterns {:release "v[0-9]*"
                :stable "stable-*"}
 :top-namespace "se.example"
 :vcs {:auto-add true
       :name "git"}}
----

A workspace contains these keys:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Key | Description

a| `:bricks` a| Present if we want to turn off `Warning 206` for one or more bricks, see xref:validations.adoc[validations].

a| `:compact-view` a| Controls the xref:dependencies.adoc#compact-view[output] from the xref:commands#info[deps] and the xref:libraries.adoc#compact-view[output] from the xref:commands.adoc#libs[libs] command so that they can be viewed in a more compact way, e.g.: `#{"deps" "libs"}`.

a| `:default-profile-name` a| The name of the profile that is automatically merged into the xref:development.adoc[development] project if xref:profile.adoc[profiles] are used and no profile is given.
An example can be found https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/a4d9d2f3e50a2b76f36ed75c4a7ba7aa9a7b0db6/examples/doc-example/deps.edn#L14-L15[here].

a| `:interface-ns` a|
All namespaces within a component with this name, `interface`, or `ifc`, will be considered the component's interface.
The name set by this argument is also used by the xref:commands.adoc#create-component[create component] command.

a| `:projects` a| A map that configures the projects in the workspace, see xref:ws-projects[projects] below.

a| `:tag-patterns` a| Holds the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[regex] patterns that are used when searching for the most recent tag in git with a matching name, explained xref:tagging.adoc[here], to calculate the latest committed sha, that will be considered the _latest stable point in time_.

a| `:top-namespace` a| The top namespace used throughout the workspace in components and bases.

a| `:vcs` a| A map with two keys, where `:name` is set to "git" which is the only supported https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control[version control system] at the moment. +
The key `:auto-add` is a boolean flag that tells whether directories and files added by the xref:commands#create[create] command should automatically be added to git or not.
|===

Only the `:top-namespace` attribute is mandatory, all other attributes will use their default values if missing.

[#ws-projects]
=== projects

The `:projects` key contains configuration for individual projects:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:workspaces:example:config:projects
----

[source,shell]
----
{"command-line" {:alias "cl"
                 :test {:exclude ["mybrick"]}
                 :necessary ["helper"]}}
 "development" {:alias "dev"}
 "user-service" {:alias "user-s"
                 :test {:setup-fn project.command-line.test-setup/setup
                        :teardown-fn project.command-line.test-setup/teardown}}}
----

Configuration for a specific project:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Key | Description

a| `:alias` a| This value is used in the output of the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command and various commands as an alternative value for the project name.

a| `:necessary` a| Allows us to turn off `Warning 206` for one or more bricks in the project, see xref:validations.adoc[Validations].

a| `:test` a| A map with test configuration for the project, see below.
|===

Test configuration under the `:test` key for a specific project:

[%autowidth]
|===
a| Key a| Description

a| `:exclude` a| Lists the bricks to be xref:testing.adoc#include-exclude[excluded] when running tests for the project.

a| `:include` a| Lists the bricks to be xref:testing#include-exclude[included] when running tests for the project.

a| `:setup-fn` a| The name of the function (namespace included) that will be executed before the tests are executed, see xref:testing#setup-and-teardown[Test setup and teardown].

a| `:teardown-fn` a| The name of the function (namespace included) that will be executed after the tests have been executed, see xref:testing#setup-and-teardown[Test setup and teardown].
|===

== projects

Each project has its own `deps.edn` configuration file.
The xref:development.adoc[development] config file lives in `./deps.edn`, while other xref:project.adoc[projects] keep them in `projects/PROJECT/deps.edn`.

The content of a configuration file can be viewed with e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:projects:command-line
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:deps {:aliases {:test {:extra-deps {}
                         :extra-paths ["test"]}
                  :uberjar {:main se.example.cli.core}}
        :deps {org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core {:mvn/version "2.13.3"}
               org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-slf4j-impl {:mvn/version "2.13.3"}
               org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}
               poly/cli {:local/root "../../bases/cli"}
               poly/user-remote {:local/root "../../components/user-remote"}}}

poly ws get:configs:bases:cli
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:deps {:aliases {:test {:extra-deps {}
                         :extra-paths ["test"]}}

Each xref:component.adoc[component] has its own `deps.edn` configuration file that lives in `components/COMPONENT/deps.edn`.

The content of a configuration file can be viewed with e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:components:user
----

[source,clojure]
----

a| `:deps` a| The content of `deps.edn`.
a| `:name` a| The component name.
a| `:type` a| The type of configuration, set to `:component` for components.
|===

== user

Settings that are unique per developer/user are stored in `~/.config/polylith/config.edn`.
If you started using the `poly` tool from version `0.2.14-alpha` or earlier, then the settings may be stored in `~/.polylith/config.edn`:

The content of the file can be viewed with:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:user
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:color-mode "dark"
 :empty-character "."
 :thousand-separator ","}
----

[%autowidth]
|===
| Key | Description

a| [[color-mode]] `:color-mode` a| Defaults to "none" on Windows, and to "dark" on other operating systems.
Valid values are "none", "light" and "dark", see the xref:colors.adoc[Colors] section.
Can be overridden with e.g.: `poly info color-mode:none`.
a| `:empty-character` a| Set to "." by default, and is used in the output from the xref:commands.adoc#deps[deps] and xref:commands.adoc#libs[libs] commands.
a| `:thousand-separator` a| Set to "," by default.
Use by the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command for number >= 1000, when passing in `:loc`.
a| `:m2-dir` a| If omitted, the `.m2` directory will be set to `USER-HOME/.m2`.
Used by the xref:commands.adoc#libs[libs] command to calculate file sizes (KB).
|===

If `~/.config/polylith/config.edn` doesn't exist, it will be created the first time the xref:create-workspace[create workspace] command is executed.

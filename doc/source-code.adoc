== Paths

In all our examples thus far, we've shown source code stored in two directories: `src` and `test`.
xref:tools-deps.adoc[Tools.deps] supports splitting source and test code into several directories, as does `poly`.

We've only shown `.clj` files in our examples, but `poly` also recognizes `.cljc` files, which you can use to share code between Clojure and ClojureScript.
(See <<frontend>> below.)

We'll contrive an example of splitting source code over multiple directories by exploring two ways of storing `.clj` and `.cljc` files.
Imagine a `company` component that contains both `.clj` and `.cljc` files.
You can choose to store both types of files in the same `src` directory:

[source,shell]
----
├── components
│   ├── company
│   │   ├── src
----

For this strategy, you'd configure the component's `deps.edn` file like so:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["src"]
 ....
----

An alternative is to store the source code in two separate directories:

[source,shell]
----
├── components
│   ├── company
│   │   ├── clj
│   │   ├── cljc
----

And configure `:paths` in the component's `deps.edn` file as:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["clj" "cljc"]
 ....
----

Some prefer this scheme, as it clearly shows where all the `.cljc` code resides.
We are not recommending one strategy over the other.
Our focus is to illustrate splitting source code over multiple paths.

== Resources

The `resources` directory stores non-source files, e.g., images or data, and lives in bricks and, optionally, projects.
To keep resource paths unique on the classpath, `poly` creates a sub-directory under `resources` when creating a brick.
For xref:component.adoc[components], the sub-directory name is the component's xref:interface.adoc[interface] name, and for xref:base.asdoc[bases], it's the base name, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
├── bases
│   ├── worker
│   │   ├── resources
│   │   │   └── worker
│   │   │       └── mydata.edn
├── components
│   ├── creator
│   │   ├── resources
│   │   │   └── creator ;; <1>
│   │   │       └── logo.png
----
<1> By default, the interface names match component names

== Frontend Code Options

The `poly` tool doesn't understand https://clojurescript.org/[ClojureScript] `.cljs` files, but it recognizes `.cljc` files, which you can use to share code between your backend and frontend.

Three frontend code organization alternatives are:

=== 1. Frontend in Base or Components

This option puts all your frontend code in a xref:base.adoc[base].

The `poly` tool recognizes `.cljc` files in the base, resulting in a ClojureScript view of the component when used from the frontend.

If you want to share the `.cljc` code with the backend, you would put that code in one or more xref:component.adoc[components].

=== 2. Frontend in a Non-`poly` Directory

Another option is to put the frontend code in a separate directory.
Two alternatives are:

==== a) Under the Workspace

[source,shell]
----
myworkspace
├── bases
├── components
├── development
├── myfrontend ;; <1>
└── projects
----
<1> Not a base, not a component, just your frontend code referenced as `:local/root`

You would include `.cljc` files from your backend code by treating it as a library and referencing it via `:local/root`.
A drawback is that changes to the frontend code files will not be detected by `poly` because they sit outside the `poly` directory structure and are, therefore, unknown to `poly`.

NOTE: We are currently https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/discussions/301[discussing] how to properly recognize and support ClojureScript within a `poly` workspace.

==== b) Outside the Workspace

Under this strategy, the frontend code sits within your git repository but physically outside of the workspace.

[source,shell]
----
myrepository
├── mybackend ;; <1>
│   ├── bases
│   ├── components
│   ├── development
│   └── projects
└── myfrontend ;; <2>
----
<1> mybackend `poly` workspace
<2> myfrontend plain old Clojure `:local/root` library

You would reference frontend `.cljc` files as a `:local/root` library in the same way as in alternative 2a.
The `poly` tool can handle both layouts; it's more a matter of preference what you choose.

=== 3. Frontend in Separate Repository

The last alternative is to put your frontend code in a separate git repository.

Some downsides to this strategy are:

* You are no longer working with a monorepo and might even have separate frontend and backend releases
* You have a greater risk of the frontend and backend code becoming out of synch

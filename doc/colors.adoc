= Colors

When we created the example workspace, the file `~/.config/polylith/config.edn` was also created:

[source,clojure]
----
{:color-mode "dark"
 :thousand-separator ","
 :empty-character "Â·"}
----

For Windows systems the `color-mode` is set to "none" and for all other systems, "dark" will be used as default.
Valid values are: "none", "light" and "dark".

In this documentation we have used the `dark` color schema, but we can switch to `light` by giving the `color-mode` argument (or by updating it in the xref:configuration.adoc#color-mode[user config]):

[source,text]
----
poly info color-mode:light
----

image::images/colors/info-light.png[width=400]

...everything suddenly looks much brighter!
The only difference between `light` and `dark` is that they use different https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/9053b190d5f3b0680ac4fe5c5f1851f7c0d40830/components/util/src/polylith/clj/core/util/colors.clj#L3-L13[codes] for grey.

If we pass in `:none`:

[source,text]
----
poly info color-mode:none
----

...then things are displayed without colors.

To refresh our memory, this is what it looked like using the dark color schema:

image::images/colors/info-dark.png[width=400]

== Colors codes

If you want to use the same colors in your terminal, here they are:

[%autowidth]
|===
| name | color | RGB

| yellow a|image::images/colors/yelow.png[] | f8eeb6
| green a|image::images/colors/green.png[] | bfefc5
| blue a|image::images/colors/blue.png[] | 77bcfc
| purple a|image::images/colors/purple.png[] | e2aeff
| red a|image::images/colors/red.png[] | ee9b9a
| grey a|image::images/colors/grey.png[] | cccccc
| black a|image::images/colors/black.png[] | 24242b
|===

If the colors look familiar to you, it's because they are more or less stolen from the https://github.com/Misophistful/borealis-cursive-theme[Borealis] color schema!
This color schema gives a really pleasant user experience when used from the text editor/IDE.

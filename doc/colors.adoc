= Colors

When we created the example workspace, the file `~/.config/polylith/config.edn` was also created:

[source,clojure]
----
{:color-mode "dark"
 :thousand-separator ","
 :empty-character "·"}
----

For Windows systems the `color-mode` is set to "none" and for all other systems,
"dark" will be used as default. Valid values are: "none", "light" and "dark".

In this documentation we have used the `dark` color schema,
but we can switch to `light` by giving the `color-mode` parameter
(or by updating it in the xref:configuration.adoc#color-mode[user config]):

[source,clojure]
----
poly info color-mode:light
----

image::images/misc/info-light.png[width=400]

...everything suddenly looks much brighter!
The only difference between `light` and `dark` is that they use different

for grey.

If we pass in `:none`:

----
poly info color-mode:none

...then things are displayed without colors.

To refresh our memory, this is what it looked like using the dark color schema:

image::images/misc/info-dark.png[width=400]

== Colors codes

If you want to use the same colors in your terminal, here they are:

|===
| name | color | RGB

| yellow a|image::images/misc/yelow.png[] | f8eeb6
| green a|image::images/misc/green.png[] | bfefc5
| blue a|image::images/misc/blue.png[] | 77bcfc
| purple a|image::images/misc/purple.png[] | e2aeff
| red a|image::images/misc/red.png[] | ee9b9a
| grey a|image::images/misc/grey.png[] | cccccc
| black a|image::images/misc/black.png[] | 24242b
|===

If the colors look familiar to you, it's because they are more or less stolen from the
https://github.com/Misophistful/borealis-cursive-theme[Borealis] color schema!
This color schema gives a really pleasant user experience when used from the text editor / IDE.

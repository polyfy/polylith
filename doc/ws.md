# The workspace structure

The `poly` tool gives us access to the data structure that represents the workspace,
which is the same structure that all the `poly` commands operate on.

Here we will use the output from the [example in the documentation](../examples/doc-example).

To list all the keys at the root, execute `poly ws get:keys` from the `examples/doc-example` directory:
```
[:bases
 :components
 :changes
 :interfaces
 :messages
 :name
 :old
 :paths
 :projects
 :settings
 :user-input
 :version
 :ws-dir
 :ws-local-dir
 :ws-reader]
```

Let's go through all the keys.

## bases

`poly ws get:bases:user-api`

```
{:interface-deps {:src ["user"], :test []},
 :lib-deps {:src {"slacker/slacker" {:size 28408,
                                     :type "maven",
                                     :version "0.17.0"}}},
 :lib-imports {:src ["se.example.user-api.api" "slacker.server"],
               :test ["clojure.test" "se.example.user-api.core"]},
 :lines-of-code {:src 13, :test 6},
 :name "user-api",
 :namespaces {:src [{:file-path "/Users/joakimtengstrand/source/polylith/examples/doc-example/bases/user-api/src/se/example/user_api/core.clj",
                     :imports ["se.example.user-api.api" "slacker.server"],
                     :name "core",
                     :namespace "se.example.user-api.core"}
                    {:file-path "/Users/joakimtengstrand/source/polylith/examples/doc-example/bases/user-api/src/se/example/user_api/api.clj",
                     :imports ["se.example.user.interface"],
                     :name "api",
                     :namespace "se.example.user-api.api"}],
              :test [{:file-path "/Users/joakimtengstrand/source/polylith/examples/doc-example/bases/user-api/test/se/example/user_api/core_test.clj",
                      :imports ["clojure.test" "se.example.user-api.core"],
                      :name "core-test",
                      :namespace "se.example.user-api.core-test"}]},
 :paths {:src ["src" "resources"], :test ["test"]},
 :type "base"}
```

- `:interface-deps` Lists the interfaces each base depens on. Here it depends on the `user` interface from the `src` context.
  This is because the `se.example.user-api.api` namespace imports `se.example.user.interface`.
  No interfaces are imported from the `test` context in this example.
- `:lib-deps` Lists the library dependencies the base depends on, defined in the `:deps` key in its `deps.edn` file
  for the `src` context, and the `:aliases > :test > :extra-deps` for the `test` context. The `:size` is in bytes.
- `:lib-imports` The name is a bit misleading as internal namespaces for the base is also included.
  - `src` Lists all imports from the `src` context except component interfaces.
  - `test` Lists all imports from the `test` context except component interfaces.
- `:lines-of-code` Total number of lines of code for this base (all namespaces included).
- `:name` Then name of the directory for this base under the `bases` directory.
- `:namespaces`
  - `:src` Lists all the namespaces that live under the `src` directory.
    - `:file-path` The absolute path to the namespace.
    - `:imports` Lists all its namespaces.
    - `:name` The name of the namespace where top namespace + base name (`se.example` + `user-api` in thie case) are skipped away.
    - `namespace` The full name of the namespace.
  - `:test` Lists all the namespaces that live under the `test` directory.
- `:paths` The paths that are specified in its `deps.edn` file (`paths` for `src` and `resources` paths + `aliases > :test > :extra-paths` for `test` paths).
- `:type` Set to "base".

## components

`poly ws get:components:user`

```
{:interface {:definitions [{:name "hello",
                            :parameters [{:name "name"}],
                            :type "function"}],
             :name "user"},
 :interface-deps {:src [], :test []},
 :lib-deps {},
 :lib-imports {:test ["clojure.test"]},
 :lines-of-code {:src 9, :test 7},
 :name "user",
 :namespaces {:src [{:file-path "/Users/joakimtengstrand/source/polylith/examples/doc-example/components/user/src/se/example/user/interface.clj",
                     :imports ["se.example.user.core"],
                     :name "interface",
                     :namespace "se.example.user.interface"}
                    {:file-path "/Users/joakimtengstrand/source/polylith/examples/doc-example/components/user/src/se/example/user/core.clj",
                     :imports [],
                     :name "core",
                     :namespace "se.example.user.core"}],
              :test [{:file-path "/Users/joakimtengstrand/source/polylith/examples/doc-example/components/user/test/se/example/user/interface_test.clj",
                      :imports ["clojure.test" "se.example.user.interface"],
                      :name "interface-test",
                      :namespace "se.example.user.interface-test"}]},
 :paths {:src ["src" "resources"], :test ["test"]},
 :type "component"}
```
Component keys are the same as for the `base` plus the `:interfaces` key:
- `:interface`
  - `:definitions` Lists all public `def`, `defn` and `defmacro` definitions in the interface namespace. If a type hint is given, 
    then `:type` will also be set and be part of the contract.
- `:interface-deps` Lists the interfaces each component depens on. This component doesn't depend on any other interface.
- `:lib-deps` Lists the library dependencies the component depends on, defined in the `:deps` key in its `deps.edn` file
  for the `src` context, and the `:aliases > :test > :extra-deps` for the `test` context.
- `:lib-imports` Lists all imports except component interfaces. The name is a bit misleading as internal namespaces for the component is also included.
- `:lines-of-code` Total number of lines of code for this compoponent (all namespaces included).
- `:name` Then name of the directory for this component under the `components` directory.
- `:namespaces`
  - `:src` Lists all the namespaces that live under the `src` directory.
    - `:file-path` The absolute path to the namespace.
    - `:imports` Lists all its namespaces.
    - `:name` The name of the namespace where top namespace + component name (`se.example` + `user` in thie case) are skipped away.
    - `namespace` The full name of the namespace.
  - `:test` Lists all the namespaces that live under the `test` directory.
- `:paths` The paths that are specified in its `deps.edn` file (`paths` for `src` and `resources` paths + `aliases > :test > :extra-paths` for `test` paths).
- `:type` Set to "component".

```

- `:changed-bases` Lists the changed bases since the sha `b339c35` (or last stable point in time if `:since` is not given).
- `:changed-components` Lists the changed components since the sha `b339c35` (or last stable point in time if `:since` is not given).
- `:changed-files` The same list that is returned by `poly diff since:b339c35`. The keys `:changed-bases`, `:changed-components` and `:changed-projects`
  are calculated from this list.
- `:changed-or-affected-projects` Lists the projects that are directly changed, e.g. its `deps.edn` file, or indirectly changed,
  e.g. if one of the bricks it incudes are changed.
- `:changed-projects` Lists the changed projects since the sha `b339c35` (or last stable point in time if `:since` is not given).
- `:git-diff-command` The git command that was executed to calculate the `:changed-files` list.
- `:project-to-bricks-to-test` A map that stores project names with a list of the bricks to test from that project if executing the `test` command.
- `:project-to-indirect-changes` A map that stores project names with a list of the bricks that are indirectly changed
  (directly changed bricks excluded). E.g. if components `a` and `b` are included in the project, and `a` has not changed,
  but `b` has changed and `a` uses `b`, then `b` will be included in the list.
- `:project-to-projects-to-test` A map that stores project names with a list of projects to test from that project if executing the `test` command.
- `:since` Set to "stable" if `since:SINCE` is not given.
- `:since-sha` The full sha if `since:SINCE` was not given, e.g. `b339c358079fa36ca20ed0163708ba010a0ffd4c`.
- `:since-tag` The name of the tag, e.g. `v0.1.0-alpha9` if `since:release` was given.

## interfaces

`poly ws get:interfaces:user`

```
{:definitions [{:name "hello", 
                :parameters [{:name "name"}], 
                :type "function"}],
 :implementing-components ["user" "user-remote"],
 :name "user",
 :type "interface"}
```

- `:definitions` A list of the public `def`, `defn` and `defmacro` definitions that are part of the interface.
  - `:name` the name of the `def`, `defn` or `defmacro` definition. If it's a multi arity function or macro,
    then each arity will stored separately.
  - `:parameters` Set for functions and macros. Specifies the function/macro parameters:
    - `:name` The name of the parameter.
    - `:type` If a type hint, e.g. `^String` is given then this attribute is set.
  - `:type` Set to `data`, `function` or `macro`.
- `:name` The name of the interface. In this case the bricks `user` and `user-remote` share the same `user`
    interface and live in the `se.example.user.interface` namespace.
- `:type` Set to "interface".

## messages

`poly ws get:messages`

```
[{:code 103,
  :message "Missing definitions in user's interface: hello[name]",
  :colorized-message "Missing definitions in user's interface: hello[name]",
  :components ["user"],
  :type "error"}]
```

To trigger this error, we commented out the `hello` function from the `user` component interface. 

- `:code` The code of the error or warning. To get a full list of existing codes, execute `poly help check`.
- `:message` The error message.
- `:colorized-message` The error message using colors so the text can be printed in color.
- `:components` Each error message can have extra keys/information, like affected components as in this case.
- `type` Set to "error" or "warning".

## name

`poly ws get:name`

```
doc-example
```

The name of the workspace directory.

## old

`poly ws get:old ws-file:ws.edn`

```
{:user-input {:args ["ws" "out:ws.edn"],
              :cmd "ws",
              :is-all false,
              :is-dev false,

              :selected-projects #{},
              :unnamed-args []}}
```

If the workspace is loaded using `ws-file:WS-FILE` then the `:old` key is populated.

- `user-input` The user input from the original `ws` file.
- `:active-profiles` If any profiles are given, then this key is added with the value 
                     of `:active-profiles` taken from the `:settings` key from the 
                     original `ws` file.

## user-input

`poly ws get:user-input`

```
{:args ["ws" "get:user-input"],
 :cmd "ws",
 :get "user-input",
 :is-all false,
 :is-dev false,
 :is-latest-sha false,
 :is-no-exit false,
 :is-run-all-brick-tests false,
 :is-run-project-tests false,
 :is-search-for-ws-dir false,
 :is-show-brick false,
 :is-show-loc false,
 :is-show-project false,
 :is-show-resources false,
 :is-show-workspace false,
 :is-verbose false,
 :selected-profiles #{},
 :selected-projects #{},
 :unnamed-args []}
```

- `:args` The arguments to the `poly` tool where the first argument is the command.
- `:cmd` The first argument to the `poly` command.
- `:get` The `ARGS` of `get:ARGS` if given.
- `:is-all` Set to `true` if `:all` is given.
- `:is-dev` Set to `true` if `:dev` is given.
- `:is-latest-sha` Set to `true` if `:latest-sha` is given.
- `:is-no-exit` Set to `true` if `:no-exit` is given. This will prevent the `poly` command
                from exiting with `System/exit`.
- `:is-run-all-brick-tests` Set to `true` if `:all` or `:all-bricks` are given.
- `:is-run-project-tests` Set to `true` if `:all` or `:project` are given.
- `:is-search-for-ws-dir` Set to `true` if `::` is given.
- `:is-show-brick` Set to `true` if `:brick` is given. Used by `poly help deps :brick`
                   to show help for the `deps` command when `brick:BRICK` is given.
- `:is-show-loc` Set to `true` if `:loc` is given. If given, then the `info` command will show the number of lines of code.
- `:is-show-project` Set to `true` if `:project` is given. Used by `poly help deps :project`
                     to show help for the `deps` command when `project:PROJECT` is given.
- `:is-show-resources` Set to `true` if `:r` or `:resources` is given. This will tell the `info` command
                       to show the `r` status flag.
- `:is-show-workspace` Set to `true` if `:workspace` is given. Used by `poly help deps :workspace`
                       to show help for the `deps` command when `workspace:WORKSPACE` is given.
- `:is-verbose` Experimental at the moment. Can be used on combination with the `test` command
                to show extra information.
- `:selected-profiles` A list with the passed in profiles, e.g. `["defult" "extra"]` if `poly info +default +extra` is executed.
- `:selected-projects` The list of projects given by `project:PROJECT` and/or `:dev` (handled as "dev" if given).
- `:unnamed-args` All given arguments that don't contain a `:`.

There are a few more user input parameters that are mainly useful if you are a maintainer of the Polylith codebase itself:

- `:is-compact` Set to `true` if `:compact` is given. Used in combination with the `libs` and `deps` commands.
- `:fake-sha` Set to `c91fdad` if `fake-sha:c91fdad` is given. Used to set the "stable since" sha for the output from the `libs` command.
- `:is-no-changes` Set to `true` if `:no-changes` is given. Used to fake that no changes have been made since the last stable point in time.
- `:is-no-exit` Set to `true` if `:no-exit` is given. Tells the `poly` command to not exit with `System/exit`.
- `:replace` Set to e.g. `[{:from "/Users/joakimtengstrand", :to "my-home"}]` if `replace:$HOME:my-home` is given. 
  It will replace this text too, so the output will actually be `[{:from "my-home", :to "my-home"}]` which is the behaviour we want
  (the whole idea with the `replace` parameter is to get the same output every time).

## version

`poly ws get:version`

```
{:release {:date "2021-07-27",
           :major 0,
           :minor 2,
           :patch 0,
           :revision "alpha10.issue66.22"},
           :name "0.2.0.alpha10.issue66.22",
 :ws {:breaking 1, 
      :non-breaking 0, 
      :type :toolsdeps2}}
```

- `:release`
  - `:date` The date of the release in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.
  - `:major` The major version, set to zero.
  - `:minor` Increased by one if any breaking changes.
  - `:patch` Increased by one for each release within a given `major.minor`.
  - `:revision` What comes after `major.minor.path`.
  - `:name` The full name of the release.
- `:ws` Versioning of the internal `ws` format, returned by `poly ws`.
  - `:breaking` Increased by one if introducing a non backwards compatible change of the `ws` format.
                The goal is that `1` is the last breaking change.
  - `:non-breaking` Increased by one when a non breaking change is added to the `ws` format.
  - `:type` Set to `:toolsdeps1` if a workspace created by `v0.1.0-alpha9` or earlier.
            Set to `:toolsdeps2` if a workspace created by `v0.2.0-alpha10` or later.

If the workspace has the old `:toolsdeps1` format (created by `v0.1.0-alpha9` or earlier) 
then it will be transformed to the latest format and the `:from` key is added:

```
{:from {:ws {:type :toolsdeps1}
 ...}
```

- `:from`
  - `:ws`
    - `:type` Set to ":toolsdeps1"

If the workspace is read from a `ws file` that was created by `v0.1.0-alpha9` or earlier,
then the `ws` structure is transformed to the new format and the `:from` key is added:

`poly ws get:version ws-file:ws1.edn`

```
{:from {:release-name "0.1.0-alpha9",
        :ws {:breaking 0, 
             :non-breaking 0, 
             :type :toolsdeps1}}
 ...
```

- `:from`
  - `:release-name` The version of the `poly` tool from which this `ws` file was created.
  - `:ws`
    - `:breaking` The breaking version of the original `ws` format.
    - `:non-breaking` The non-breaking version of the original `ws` format.
    - `:type` The type of the original `ws` file.

## ws-dir

`poly ws get:ws-dir`

```
"/Users/joakimtengstrand/source/polylith/examples/doc-example"
```

The absolute path of the workspace directory.

## ws-local-dir

`poly ws get:ws-local-dir`

```
"examples/doc-example"
```

If the workspace lives at the same level as the git root, which is the case if we create
a workspace with `poly create workspace ...`, then this attribute is not set.
If the workspace lives inside the git root as a directory or sub directory, then it
is set to the relative path to the git root.

## ws-reader

`poly ws get:ws-reader`

```
{:file-extensions ["clj" "cljc"],
 :language "Clojure",
 :name "polylith-clj",
 :project-url "https://github.com/polyfy/polylith",
 :type-position "postfix"}
```

This structure explains different aspects of the tool that created this `ws` structure
(the `poly` tool in this case) and the idea is that new tooling could support the
`ws` format and populate this structure so that it can be used by external tooling.

- `:file-extensions` Lists the supported file extensions.
- `:language` The name of the supported language.
- `:name` The name of the workspace reader.
- `:project-url` The url to the workspace reader tool.
- `:type-position` Set to `postfix` because types (type hints) come before the arguments, 
                   in Clojure, e.g. `^String arg`. In some other languages like Scala, 
                   the types come after the arguments.

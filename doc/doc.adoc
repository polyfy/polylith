The poly tool comes with a xref:commands.adoc#doc[doc] command that helps us access the web based documentation.
The easiest way to access different parts of the documentation is by first starting a xref:shell.adoc[shell]:

[source,shell]
----
poly
----

We can now execute the `doc` command to open the start page of this documentation:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc
----

image::images/doc/top-doc.png[]

At the top of the page we have a number of useful links:

* image:images/doc/clj-poly-lib.png[] links to the different versions of the `clj-poly` library.

* image:images/doc/clj-poly-doc.png[] links to http://localhost:8000/versions/polylith/clj-poly[different versions] of this documentation.

* image:images/doc/clj-doc.png[] links to https://cljdoc.org/[cljdoc.org].

* image:images/doc/polylith-repo.png[] links to the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[polylith] GitHub repo.

* image:images/gitbook-badge.png[] links to the documentation for the latest https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases[release].

* image:images/cljdoc-snapshot-badge.png[] links to the latest `SNAPSHOT` build of this documentation,
which we should use if we work on code in the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[master] branch
between releases.

* image:images/doc/slack.png[] links to the https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/C013B7MQHJQ[#polylith] channel
in the clojurians workspace in Slack.

====
NOTE: The `SNAPSHOT` documentation is built every time we commit something to the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[master] branch,
which is documented xref:polylith-ci-setup.adoc#releases[here].
This is useful if we use the `poly` tool as a xref:install.adoc#github-dependency[GitHub dependency]
and want to access its documentation.
====

If we type `doc` followed by a space, the different help categories are listed:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc
help   more   page   ws
----

We can either use the left menu or the `doc` command to access different pages:

image::images/doc/doc-overview.png[]

== page

The `page` parameter is used to navigate the `poly` tool documentation. We can pass in `page:` to list all pages,
which are also accessible in the left menu (notice that it ends with a colon):

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc page:
base                     libraries
build                    migrate
clojure-cli-tool         naming
colors                   parameters
component                polyx
configuration            profile
context                  project
continuous-integration   readme
dependencies             shell
development              source-code
doc                      tagging
example-systems          tap
explore-the-workspace    test-runners
flags                    testing
git-hooks                tools-deps
git                      upgrade
install                  validations
interface                workspace
introduction
----

If we select a page, it will be opened in a browser on your machine, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
doc page:flags
----

== help

The `help` parameter takes us to the xref:commands.adoc[commands] help page:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help
----

We can list all help commands like this:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help:
check                deps-project         overview
create-base          deps-workspace       shell
create-component     deps                 switch-ws
create-project       diff                 tap
create-workspace     doc                  test
create               info                 version
deps-brick           libs                 ws
deps-project-brick   migrate
----

...and select a command:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help:check
----

...which take us to the web based help for the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command.
We will get the same output if we execute the corresponding `help` command:

[source,shell]
----
example$ help check
----

== ws

The `ws` parameter takes us to the xref:workspace-structure.adoc[Workspace structure] documentation:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws
----

We can list all top keys with:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws:
bases          name           version
changes        old            ws-dir
components     paths          ws-local-dir
configs        projects       ws-reader
interfaces     settings       ws-type
messages       user-input
----

...and open the description for a specific top key, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws:configs
----

== more

The `more` parameter stores all other documentation that is not about the `poly` tool:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc more:
blog-posts    python-tool   workspaces
high-level    slack
podcasts      videos
----

Let's dig into the different categories:

=== blog posts

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc more:blog-posts:
a-fresh-take-on-monorepos-in-python
how-polylith-came-to-life
the-micro-monolith-architecture
the-monorepos-polylith-series
the-origin-of-complexity

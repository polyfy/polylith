:toc:

The `poly` tool includes a xref:commands.adoc#doc[doc] command to open web-based documentation.
The xref:shell.adoc[shell]'s autocompletion support makes listing and accessing different parts of the documentation a breeze, so go ahead and xref:shell.adoc#launch[start one up]:

[source,shell]
----
poly
----

Run the `doc` command to open the start page of the `poly` tool documentation:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc
----

TIP: The `example$` prompt shows that we are working from our xref:introduction.adoc[tutorial] `example` xref:workspace.adoc[workspace], but you can experiment with the `doc` command from any workspace.


You should see the page open in your web browser:

The page has some helpful links:

NOTE: Useful documentation starts at version `0.2.18`.

[NOTE]
====
We automatically build a `SNAPSHOT` release and its associated documentation for every commit to the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[master] branch; see xref:polylith-ci-setup.adoc#releases[releases] for more details.

When you use a `SNAPSHOT` release via a xref:install.adoc#github-dependency[GitHub dependency], you'll be referring to its associated `SNAPSHOT` documentation.
====

Use the search box or the left menu to navigate to pages and explore API docs:

image::images/doc/doc-overview.png[]

And if you scroll down to the bottom of the left menu:

image::images/doc/doc-overview-scrolled.png[]

Return to the poly shell to explore, then open other available docs at any time.

From the poly shell, type `doc` followed by a space to see the different help categories:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc
help   more   page   ws
----

Doc categories:

* <<page>> - web pages constitute the `poly` tool user manual, which you are reading a page of right now!
* <<help>> - `poly` xref:commands.adoc[commands] docs
* <<ws>> - xref:workspace-structure.adoc[workspace structure] docs
* <<more>> - various other information: conceptual docs, blog posts, videos, podcasts, example workspaces, and other links

Let's dig into these categories.

[[page]]
== page

Use the `page` argument to open a specific `poly` tool documentation page in your web browser.
Notice that the shell lists all pages:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc page:
artifacts                flags                    readme
base                     git-hooks                shell
build                    git                      source-code
colors                   install                  state
component                interface                tagging
configuration            introduction             tap
contact                  libraries                test-runners
continuous-integration   license                  testing
dependencies             naming                   tools-deps
developing-poly          polylith-ci-setup        upgrade
development              polyx                    validations
doc                      production-systems       versions
example-systems          profile                  visualize-the-repo
explore-the-workspace    project                  workspace
----

These are the same pages you see listed in the left menu in your web browser.

When you select a page, `poly` will open it in your web browser.
To open the `flags` page:

[source,text]
----
doc page:flags
----

[[help]]
== help

The `help` argument takes you to the `poly` xref:commands.adoc[commands] documentation:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc help
----

Ask the shell to list all command help with:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc help:
check                deps-project         shell
create-base          deps-workspace       switch-ws
create-component     deps                 tap
create-project       diff                 test
create-workspace     doc                  version
create               info                 ws
deps-brick           libs
deps-project-brick   overview
----

To open the `check` command:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc help:check
----

The `poly` tool will open help for the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command in your web browser.

[TIP]
====
You can get the same help at your terminal via:

[source,text]
----
example$ help check
----
====

[[ws]]
== ws

The `ws` argument takes you to the xref:workspace-structure.adoc[Workspace structure] documentation:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc ws
----

List all top keys via:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc ws:
bases          name           user-input
changes        old            version
components     paths          ws-dir
configs        profiles       ws-local-dir
interfaces     projects       ws-reader
messages       settings       ws-type
----

Open the description for a specific top key in your web browser:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc ws:configs
----

[[more]]
== more

The `more` argument covers all other documentation and links that are not specifically about the `poly` tool:

[source,text]
----
example$ doc more:
blog-posts    python-tool
high-level    slack
in-japanese   videos
podcasts      workspaces
----

Let's dig into the different categories:

[#blog-posts]
=== blog posts

Open blog posts via:

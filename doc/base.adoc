= Base

A `base` is similar to a xref:component.adoc[component] except for two things:

* It doesn't have an xref:interface.adoc[interface].

* It exposes a public API to the outside world.

The lack of an xref:interface.adoc[interface] makes bases less composable than components.
This is fine; the sole purpose of a `base` is to act as a bridge between the real world and the xref:component.adoc[components] it delegates to (via the components' interfaces).
This structure gives us the modularity we need to build simple, understandable services and tools.

Let's continue with our xref:introduction.adoc[tutorial].
The last thing you did was xref:component.adoc#create-component[create a component].
Run the following xref:commands.adoc#create-base[create base] command to create a `cli` base:

[source,shell]
----
poly create base name:cli
----

Your workspace should now look like this:

[source,shell]

<1> new `cli` base

[[add-to-deps-edn]]
Edit your `./deps.edn` to add your newly created base:

[source,clojure]
----
 :aliases  {:dev {:extra-paths ["development/src"]

                  :extra-deps {poly/user {:local/root "components/user"}
                               poly/cli  {:local/root "bases/cli"}  ;; <1>

                               org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}}}

            :test {:extra-paths ["components/user/test"
                                 "bases/cli/test"]} ;; <2>
----
<1> Add the `cli` base as a dependency
<2> Add the `cli` base tests

TIP: Cursive users: refresh your IDE to pick up the updates.

Now, add some code to the base:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns se.example.cli.core
  (:require [se.example.user.interface :as user])
  (:gen-class)) ;; <1>

(defn -main [& args] ;; <2>
  (println (user/hello (first args)))
  (System/exit 0))
----
<1> https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/gen-class[:gen-class] tells the Clojure compiler to generate a Java class
<2> which allows the JVM to invoke `-main` when the `cli` base is invoked from the command line

The `poly` tool generated a `deps.edn` file for the `cli` base:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["src" "resources"]
 :deps {}
 :aliases {:test {:extra-paths ["test"]
                  :extra-deps {}}}}
----

This is identical to the xref:component#generated-deps-edn[deps.edn poly generated when you created the user component]. It will soon be needed when we create a xref:project.adoc[project].

IMPORTANT: You never add a dependency from a base `deps.edn` to a component.
The `poly` tool will automatically wire the `cli` base to the `user` component via its xref:interface.adoc[interface] after you've added them to your xref:project.adoc[project].
Bases, or bricks for that matter, are unaware of concrete components; they only talk to xref:interface.adoc[interfaces].

We are getting closer to building a deployable xref:artifacts.adoc[artifact], which will turn your code into something useable, a command-line tool.
To get there, you must first create a xref:project.adoc[project].

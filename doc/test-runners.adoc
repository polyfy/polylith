Starting with version `0.2.15`, the `poly` tool lets you choose your test runners.

[IMPORTANT]
====
- Starting with version `0.2.19`, you need at least `0.8.4` of the Kaocha test runner.
- Starting with version `0.3.0`, you need at least `0.7.0` of the External test runner.
====

There are two types of test runners: xref:#in-process[in-process] and xref:#external[external].

Polylith comes bundled with an in-process https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/9053b190d5f3b0680ac4fe5c5f1851f7c0d40830/components/clojure-test-test-runner/src/polylith/clj/core/clojure_test_test_runner/core.clj#L85-L99[test runner] that uses https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html[Clojure's testing framework].
This is the default test runner.

If you want to run tests with an external test runner, we recommend xref:#sean-external-test-runner[Sean Corfield's external test runner].

You can also xref:#write-your-own[write your own custom test runner].

[[in-process]]
== In-Process Test Runner

As you have learned, the `poly` tool can run your tests incrementally.
It creates an isolated classloader for each project and runs your tests within that classloader.
An in-process runner avoids process startup time costs.
It runs all tests in the same process.

For in-process test runners, the `poly` tool determines which bricks and projects are affected, calculates the classpath for each project, creates an isolated classloader, and passes it to the test runner for execution.

The `poly` tool, by default, uses an in-process test-runner.

[[external]]
== External Test Runner

The alternative to the in-process isolated classloader approach is to execute each project's tests in a separate external Java subprocess.
The advantage of this approach is that you have complete control of the test execution, and memory is released after each project when the subprocess terminates.
Use an external test runner if you have issues with the in-process test-runner.

The `poly` tool will still determine the changed bricks and projects and calculate the classpath for each project.
However, the external test runner will launch a subprocess to run the tests.

IMPORTANT: The `poly` tool will not run the xref:testing.adoc#setup-and-teardown[test setup and teardown] functions for external test runners.
The external test runner must run these functions within the external process it creates.

[[custom-test-runner]]
== Use a Custom Test Runner

To use a custom test runner, add it to your `poly` tool classpath.
An ideal place to do this is the `:poly` alias in your `./deps.edn` file:

[source,clojure,subs="+attributes"]
----
{:aliases
 {:poly
  {:extra-deps
   {polylith/clj-poly
    {:mvn/version "{poly-version}"}

    io.github.seancorfield/polylith-external-test-runner ;; <1>
    {:git/tag "v0.6.1" :git/sha "d0f51c2"
     :deps/root "projects/runner"}

    io.github.imrekoszo/polylith-kaocha ;; <2>
    {:git/tag "v0.8.6" :git/sha "7282409"}
----
<1> We've added xref:#sean-external-test-runner[Sean Corfield's external test runner], as one example
<2> And xref:#imre-kaocha-test-runner[Imre Imre Kószó's Kaocha test runner] as another example. Don't forget to configure the kaocha-wrapper at the project level, see the documentation or https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/tree/master/examples/test-runners[this] example project.

TIP: You can also have your custom test runner within the same Polylith workspace and depend on it via `:local/root`.

Once you have your test runner on the classpath, add it to our workspace configuration so that the `poly` tool can use it instead of the default test runner.

You can override the default global test runner under the `:test` key in your `workspace.edn`. Here are three examples:

[[create-test-runner]]
[source,clojure]
----
{...
 ; Global test configuration, used as default for every project.
 :test {:create-test-runner [org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create]} ;; <1>

 ; Project specific configurations
 :projects {"foo" {:alias "foo"}
            "bar" {:alias "barr"}
            "baz" {:alias "baz"}}}
----
<1> Override default global test runner

NOTE: You can specify multiple test runners.
The `poly` tool will run each test runner for each tested project.

You can override the global test runner for a project.
Add a `:test` key in the project's configuration in your `workspace.edn` to select project-specific test runners:

[source,clojure]
----
{...
 ; Global test configuration, used as default for every project.
 :test {:create-test-runner [org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create]}

 ; Project specific configurations
 :projects {"foo" {:alias "foo"
                   ; Use another test runner only for this project
                   :test  {:create-test-runner [polylith-kaocha.test-runner/create]}}

            "bar" {:alias "bar"
                   ; Use the poly default test runner instead of the global test-runner
                   :test  {:create-test-runner [:default]}}

            "baz" {:alias "bz"
                   ; Use both the poly default and the example test runner for this project
                   :test {:create-test-runner [:default
                                               org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create]}}}}
----

[[write-your-own]]
== Implement Your Own Custom Test Runner

Polylith supports writing test runners with two protocols: `TestRunner` and `ExternalTestRunner`.
You can use these protocols to easily plugin custom test runner(s) into the `poly` tool.

See our relevant API docs:

*  link:{cljdoc-api-url}/polylith.clj.core.test-runner-contract.interface#TestRunner[TestRunner]
*  link:{cljdoc-api-url}/polylith.clj.core.test-runner-contract.interface#ExternalTestRunner[ExternalTestRunner]

To implement your custom test runner, create a single-arity constructor function that reifies the `TestRunner` protocol.
Optionally, reify the `ExternalTestRunner` protocol to make an external test runner.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns se.example.example-test-runner)

...

(defn create [{:keys [workspace project test-settings is-verbose color-mode changes]}]
  ...

  (reify
    test-runner-contract/TestRunner
    (test-runner-name [this] ...)

    (test-sources-present? [this] ...)

    (tests-present? [this runner-opts] ...)

    (run-tests [this runner-opts] ...)

    ; Optional, only if you want an external test runner
    test-runner-contract/ExternalTestRunner
    (external-process-namespace [this] ...)))
----

The `poly` tool will call your constructor function to get an instance of your test runner for each project test run.
The constructor function will receive a map as the single argument:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Key | Description

| `:workspace`
a| The workspace map.
This map contains `:user-input`, which you can use to specify additional arguments for runtime configuration.

| `:project`
a| A map containing details for the project that `poly` is currently testing.

| `:test-settings`
a| Test settings for the project that `poly` is currently testing.
The `poly` tool extracts this information from `workspace.edn`.

| `:is-verbose`
a| When `true` the `poly` tool is running tests in verbose mode.

| `:color-mode`
a| The color mode under which the `poly` tool is currently running.

| `:changes`
// TODO: link back to definition of stable point in time
a| A map of changes since the last stable point in time.

|===

[[test-configuration]]
== Test configuration

If you create your own test runner or use one from the community, it can be useful to add snippets of test configuration when running the xref:commands.adoc#test[test] command.

The test snippets can be configured in workspace.edn under `:test-configs` (see the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/examples/test-runners/workspace.edn[test-runners] example):

[source,clojure]
----
{
 ...

 :test {:create-test-runner org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create}

 :test-configs {:default-test-runner  {:create-test-runner [:default]}
                :external-test-runner {:create-test-runner [org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create]}
                :kaocha-test-runner   {:create-test-runner [polylith-kaocha.test-runner/create]}
                :exclude-dummy        {:org.corfield/external-test-runner {:focus {:exclude [:dummy]}}}
                :exclude-integration  {:org.corfield/external-test-runner {:focus {:exclude [:integration]}}}}}
...
}
----

If we run the test command, e.g. `poly test`, then the test configuration specified by the `:test` key will be passed to the test runner(s). Let's start a shell and verify this, from the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/tree/master/examples/test-runners[examples/test-runners] directory:

[source,shell]
----
poly
----

Now you can check the content of the `:test` key:
[source,shell]
----
test-runners$ ws get:settings:test
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:create-test-runner org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create}
----

Yes, it looked the same. Let's use the default test runner:
[source,shell]
----
test-runners$ ws get:settings:test with:default-test-runner
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:create-test-runner [:default]}
----

The old `org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create` value was replaced by `[:default]`.

If the old value instead was set to `[org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create]` then the two vectors would instead been merged into `[org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create :defalt]`.

Both `default-test-runner` and `kaocha-test-runner` store their values in a vector, and if we select both, the result will be merged:

[source,shell]
----
test-runners$ ws get:settings:test with:default-test-runner:kaocha-test-runner
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:create-test-runner [:default polylith-kaocha.test-runner/create]}
----

Here is another example, where `:integration` and `:dummy` are concatenated:

[source,shell]
----
test-runners$ ws get:settings:test with:exclude-integration:exclude-dummy
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:create-test-runner org.corfield.external-test-runner.interface/create,
 :org.corfield/external-test-runner {:focus {:exclude [:integration :dummy]}}}
----

Now when we understand how test configuration can be added, we can run the test command using the default test runner:

[source,shell]
----
test-runners$ test with:default-test-runner
----

== Test Runners from the Community

The default test runner works fine in most cases and is simple and fast.
Sometimes, using the same classloader for all your tests in the workspace doesn't give enough isolation.
In this case, the External Test Runner is a good choice.
If you switch to the Kaocha Test Runner, you will get more options for running your tests.

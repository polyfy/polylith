= Tap

We created the `tap` command to support xref:developing-poly.adoc[developing poly], but
you might find it an interesting way to browse the internal xref:workspace-structure.adoc[workspace structure].

This command opens a separate https://github.com/djblue/portal[portal] window.

TIP: Portal is an excellent Clojure tool that makes browsing data a joy.
Whether or not you use our `tap` command, we recommend you check out https://github.com/djblue/portal[portal].

The `tap` command only works with the `poly` xref:shell.adoc[shell].
You can invoke it in two different ways:

1. Via the `:tap` argument when xref:shell.adoc#launching[launching a poly shell]:
+
[source,shell]
----
poly :tap
----
2. By running the xref:commands.adoc#tap[tap] command from a `poly` shell:
+
[source,text]
----
example$ tap
----

You'll see a separate portal window open; here, we show it placed to the right of the `poly` shell:

Click on the `:worskpace` key to dig into the xref:workspace-structure.adoc[workspace structure]:

Any time the `poly` tool invokes https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/tap%3E[tap>], you'll see the output in the portal window.
Starting with version `0.2.18` of `poly`, we only `tap>` the workspace structure to keep output to portal minimal and clean.

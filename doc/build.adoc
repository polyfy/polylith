= Build

The `poly` tool doesn't include any `build` commands.
That's because we don't want `poly` to restrict your build pipeline in any way.
Instead, `poly` lets you choose how to build your deployable artifacts for your particular pipeline.
Whether you choose simple build scripts or cloud-based build tools, `poly` doesn't get in the way.

Let's continue with our xref:introduction.adoc[tutorial].
The last thing you did was xref:project.adoc[create a command-line project].
Let's add build support to create an executable jar file for the `command-line` project.

Per its philosophy, you'll notice that `poly` did not generate any build scripts for your `example` workspace.

We'll be using https://github.com/clojure/tools.build[Clojure tools.build] to build your jar.
This is a common choice for xref:tools-deps.adoc[tools.deps] projects.
We've created a sample link:/examples/doc-example/build.clj[build.clj] for you.
Copy it to your `example` workspace root:

[source,shell]
----
example
├── build.clj
...
----

Add the uberjar configuration expected by our `build.clj` to your `command-line` project by adding `:uberjar` alias to `projects/command-line/deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:deps {poly/user {:local/root "../../components/user"}
        poly/cli  {:local/root "../../bases/cli"}

        org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}}

 :aliases {:test {:extra-paths []
                  :extra-deps  {}}

           :uberjar {:main se.example.cli.core}}} ;; <1>
----
<1> Add `:uberjar` alias describing the main entry point

Add a `:build` alias to your workspace `./deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases {...
           :build {:deps {io.github.clojure/tools.build {:mvn/version "0.9.6"} ;; <1>
                          org.clojure/tools.deps {:mvn/version "0.16.1281"}}  ;; <2>
                   :paths ["build/resources"] ;; <3>
                   :ns-default build} ;; <4>
----
<1> Clojure `tools.build` support
<2> Our `build.clj` happens to use `tools.deps`
<3> An example of adding some resources to our classpath
<4> Points to our `build.clj`

[TIP]
====
*Cursive Users*:
Select the `build` alias and refresh the IDE:

image::images/build/aliases.png[width=400]

Add `build` to Options in the REPL settings + restart the REPL:

image::images/build/add-build-to-repl-settings.png[width=600]

*Older Versions of Cursive*

If you are still using Cursive pre v1.13.0 we recommend that you upgrade.

If you are unable to upgrade, you'll need to set Options to `dev,test,build` instead.

You may also need to add the workspace root dir to your paths in your workspace `./deps.edn` if the IDE doesn't recognize `build.clj` as source code:

[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases  {...
            :build {...
                    :extra-paths ["."] ;; <1>
----
<1> Add workspace root dir to paths if necessary
====

== Try it out

Now that you have everything set up, build the `command-line` jar by executing the following from the `example` workspace root dir:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -T:build uberjar :project command-line
----

You should see some output:

[source,shell]
----
Compiling se.example.cli.core...
Building uberjar target/command-line.jar...
Uberjar is built.
----

Congratulations!
You've just built your first artifact from a deployable project.
Try running it:

[source,shell]
----
cd projects/command-line/target
java -jar command-line.jar Lisa
----

[source,shell]
----
Hello Lisa!
----

Nice, it worked!

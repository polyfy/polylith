= Dependencies

If you are looking for library dependencies, then visit the xref:libraries.adoc[Libraries] section.

To explain dependencies, we will use the
https://github.com/furkan3ayraktar/clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app[RealWorld example app].

Start by cloning the project by executing these commands from outside the example workspace,
e.g. the parent folder of our example workspace:

[source,shell]
----
clone-from-here
├── example
└── clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app
----

[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:furkan3ayraktar/clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app.git
cd clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app
----

Before we continue, it may be worth mentioning that most commands,
except the xref:commands.adoc#test[test] and xref:commands.adoc#create[create] commands,
can be executed from other workspaces by giving `ws-dir`, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly check ws-dir:../example
----

Another way of giving the `ws-dir` is to pass in `::`
which will set it to the first parent directory that contains a `workspace.edn` file, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
cd projects/realworld-backend
poly info ::
----

...which in this case is the same as:

[source,shell]
----
poly info ws-dir:../..
----

Now let's have a look at the workspace:

[source,shell]
----
cd ../..
poly info
----

Now we have some bricks to play with!

Let's list all dependencies by executing the xref:commands.adoc#deps[deps] command:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps
----

image::images/dependencies/deps.png[width=370]

This lists all dependencies in the workspace. Notice the yellow color in the headers.
They are yellow because components only depend on interfaces (bases can also depend on other bases).
Each `x` is a `src` dependency, while a `t` means that we only use code from the `test` context
(code that lives in any of the directories specified in `:aliases > :test > :extra-paths`).

If we read the diagram horizontally,
we can see that the `article` component uses the `database`, `profile`, and `spec` interfaces.
If we read it vertically, we can see that the `article` is used by the `comment` and `rest-api` bricks.

This is also what is shown if we specify `article` as brick:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps brick:article
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-brick.png[width=350]

To list the component dependencies, we need to specify a project:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps project:rb
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-project.png[width=350]

Now, all the headers are green,
and that is because all the implementing components are known within the selected project.
The `+` signs mark indirect dependencies, while `-` signs mark indirect test dependencies (not present here).
An example is the `article` component that uses `log` indirectly: `article > database > log`.

[#compact-view]
If we have many libraries, they can be viewed in a more compact format:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps project:rb :compact
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-project-compact.png[width=300]

This can be set permanently by setting `:compact-views #{"deps"}` in `workspace.edn`.

We can also show dependencies for a specific brick within a project:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps project:rb brick:article
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-brick-project.png[width=350]

== Accessability

The `poly` tool introduces restrictions on what code we can access:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Entity | Accessible from the `:src` context | Accessible from the `:test` context | Caution

| Component | Can only access xref:interface.adoc[interface] namespaces, but no other namespace. |
Can access any namespace. |
Accessing another component's test code from a test, will make it harder to swap out (replace) that component,
as the replacing component must implement the same set of test functions. +
A better strategy is to put the shared code in a separate test helper component,
and depend on that component's interface.

| Base | Can access xref:interface.adoc[interface] namespaces, but no other component namespace.
Can access any `base` namespace. | Can access any namespace. |

| Project | Can access any namespace. | Can access any namespace. |
It's possible to create a `src` directory for a project that lives under the `projects` directory, and put production code in there.
But try to avoid this, because this code will not be checked by the `poly` tool,
and we need a really good reason for putting code here.
|===

== Circular dependencies

The `poly` tool is checking for circular dependencies.
If we have a dependency chain like A > B > A, or A > B > C > A,
then we will get an "Error 104 - Circular dependencies".
To read more about this and other errors, execute the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command.

= Artifacts
:cljdoc-api-url: https://cljdoc.org/d/polylith/clj-poly/CURRENT/api

We assemble our `poly` bricks (xref:component.adoc[components] and xref:base.adoc[bases]) in xref:project.adoc[deployable projects] from which we build artifacts.

The base (a project typically has a single base) acts as the runtime entry point.

The `poly` tool has no say in what type of artifacts you build or how you xref:build.adoc[build] them.
Some artifact examples are:

* REST APIs
* Lambda functions
* Command line tools

== Libraries

A library is different than other types of artifacts.
It does not need a xref:base.adoc[base] since clients talk through its xref:interface.adoc[interface] directly.

Instead, you can create an `api` component that exposes the functionality of your library.
A good example is the {cljdoc-api-url}/polylith.clj.core.api[clj-poly] library that includes an link:/components/api/src/polylith/clj/core/api/interface.clj[api] component.

=== Caveats on Publishing Multiple Libraries

If you want to publish more than one library from your workspace, you must build all library artifacts from the same revision of your workspace sources and ensure they all use the same versioning pattern.

We recommend a naming convention of `{libfamily}-{libname}-{version}.jar`.
For version `1.2.3` of libnames `foo` and `bar` under libfamily `thingorama`, you'd build:

* `thingorama-bar-1.2.3.jar`
* `thingorama-foo-1.2.3.jar`

Including a libfamily makes it easier to find/sort libraries and makes it clear they belong to the same family of libraries.

The burden of ensuring no version mismatches occur when using multiple libraries from a family of libraries falls on the user of those libraries.
For example, a user may directly reference `thingorama-foo-1.2.3.jar`, but suppose some other library they depend on references `thingorama-bar-1.0.0.jar`.
It is up to the user to ensure they bring in the compatible `thingorama-bar-1.2.3.jar`.

Issue https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/issues/212[212] explores the problems of isolating libraries that share components.
See Sean Corfield's comments for an excellent explanation of the issue.

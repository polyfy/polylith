= Production Systems

Here, we list some companies that use Polylith in production.

TIP: The `info`, `deps`, and `libs` reports on this page were generated with xref:polyx.adoc[polyx] and its xref:commands.adoc#overview[overview] command.
We cover `polyx` and these reports later in the documentation.

== Scrintal

http://scrintal.com[Scrintal's] first commit dates back to April 2019 and the workspace has used Polylith since day one.
Polylith enabled us to experiment fast locally and ship features easily.
The complete buy-in to Polylith paid off when we started pivoting our product at the end of 2020, as even though we are changing it to a completely new product, most bricks can be shared and reused across all our products.

== World Singles Networks

Connecting hearts all over the world.

https://worldsinglesnetworks.com[World Singles Networks] have helped make 4.9 million human connections, on more than 100 web properties, in every country on the planet.
The entire back end of our online dating platform is built with Clojure and we've been using it in production for over a decade.

Our migration to Polylith started in April, 2021 and completed in December, 2022.
Our codebase is 136K lines of Clojure.
Polylith has enabled us to increase modularity, reduce coupling, improve testability,
and focus more on the importance of naming -- making it easier to find existing code and to decide where new code should live.

The concept of "swappable implementations" for component interfaces has allowed us to more easily share code between a variety of applications that need to run in difference contexts, such as running without a database, or on older JVMs.

== Greenlabs

https://greenlabs.co.kr[Greenlabs] is an agtech startup located in Seoul, South Korea.

We have been using Clojure since 2020 and adopted Polylith in March 2022.
Our codebase is 93K lines of Clojure.
We have chosen an event-driven architecture for backend systems, with Kafka at the center and a bunch of AWS Lambdas around it.
Thanks to Polylith, we've been able to easily manage and deploy multiple serverless projects from a single repository. It's especially helpful for modularizing code and understanding dependencies.

== Polylith

image::images/production-systems/polylith.png[link="images/production-systems/polylith.png"]

Polylith is mainly developed on a non-profit basis by Joakim Tengstrand with help from Furkan Bayraktar, James Trunk, and other contributors.

The https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[polylith] codebase itself is structured as a Polylith workspace.
We made our initial commit on June 9, 2019.
The Polylith way of working gives us a range of benefits, such as decoupled building blocks that are easy to find, change, reuse, and reason about.
We combine these building blocks to create the `poly` and `polyx` command line tools, and the `clj-poly` library.

== Add your Company Here!

Please get in touch with us if you use Polylith and don't see your company here!

To be added, create an overview image with the xref:polyx.adoc[polyx] command (from the workspace root):

[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:polyx overview out:yourcompanyname.png :no-changes
----

...or export the workspace to a file:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:poly ws out:yourcompanyname.edn :no-changes
----

Then email the file to joakim.tengstrand(at)gmail.com with a brief description of your experience with Polylith and a link to your company.

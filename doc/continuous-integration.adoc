= Continuous Integration

When setting up continuous integration, we sometimes want to keep track of changes per project.
To support this we need to add tag patterns for the projects we want to build, e.g.:

[source,clojure]
----
 :tag-patterns {:stable "stable-*"
                :release "v[0-9]*"
                :myproject "myproject-*"}
----

When our build is triggered, e.g. via a webhook, we can ask the `poly` tool what projects have changed since the last successful build:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:changes:changed-or-affected-projects since:myproject
----

...outputs, e.g.:

[source,clojure]
----
["invoicer" "myproject"]
----

If `myproject` is returned, which is the case here, then we know that this project needs to be built and deployed, as long as all tests also pass.
After a successful build, we can tag the repository with e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
git tag myproject-1
----

We want to keep the release tags, which is the reason each tag gets its own unique tag name, e.g. `myproject-1`, `myproject-2`, and so on.
It's not important that the IDs are sequential.
The tool will always sort them by the order they exist in git anyway.

If the CI build is set up so that it builds all projects in one go, then we could first start by asking what projects we have:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:projects:keys skip:dev
----

The `skip:dev` argument tells the tool to ignore the `development` project
(we are not interested in deploying that project).
More than one project can be ignored, e.g. `skip:dev:invoicer`, where both project names and aliases can be used.

Then we can ask for changed or affected projects:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:changes:changed-or-affected-projects since:release skip:dev
----

This will list all projects that need to be deployed since the latest tag that matches `release-*`.

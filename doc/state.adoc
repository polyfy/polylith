= State

Managing the lifecycle and dependencies of things like web servers and databases can be complex and error-prone. State management tools like https://github.com/stuartsierra/component[Component], https://github.com/weavejester/integrant[Integrant], and https://github.com/tolitius/mount[Mount] simplify this process by providing a structured way to handle initialization, configuration, and dependencies.

Here is a list with examples that uses Polylith:

Hopefully there will soon also be an example in Mount.

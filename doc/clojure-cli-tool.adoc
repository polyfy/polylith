= Clojure CLI Tool

The `poly` tool uses its own syntax when passing in arguments.
When using the `poly` command as a Clojure CLI Tool (see xref:install.adoc#_install_as_clojure_cli_tool[Install using Clojure CLI]) we instead use the standard way of passing in arguments as pairs.

The "native" `poly` tool has the following argument structure:

* the command, followed by
** zero or more entities (e.g., `create` can be followed by `component`), followed by:
*** named arguments (e.g., `project:example`)
*** flag arguments (e.g., `:loc`)
*** profiles (e.g., `+remote`)

Because "exec args" must follow key/value syntax, the argument structure for `-Tpoly` is:

* the command (which is the "exec fn"), followed by
- entity to name the first argument(s) to create or help,
- named arguments as key/value pairs (e.g., `project example`),
- flag arguments as keys with true or false values (e.g., `loc true`),
- profiles to list any profiles to enable, without the leading + (e.g., `profiles '[remote]'`).

For convenience, most arguments can be provided as symbols rather than requiring quoted strings:

[source,shell]
----
# strings have to be quoted for EDN and the shell:
clojure -Tpoly info project '"example"'
# the following shorthand is allowed:
clojure -Tpoly info project example
----

Both `project` and `profile` exist in singular form, taking a symbol or string, and in a plural form, taking a vector of symbols or strings:

[source,shell]
----
# select more than one project:
clojure -Tpoly info projects '[example cli]'
# select just one profile:
clojure -Tpoly info profile remote
----

Some poly commands treat `:brick` and `:project` as flag arguments and other expect `brick:name` or `project:name` as named arguments.
When using "exec args", the meaning is determined by whether the value is boolean or not:

[source,shell]
----
# select all projects:
clojure -Tpoly info project true # flag argument
# select a specific project:
clojure -Tpoly info project cli # named argument
----

Since the exec argument format for create becomes verbose, there are four shortcut arguments:

[source,shell]
----
# full create command syntax:
clojure -Tpoly create entity component name user
# shorthand:
clojure -Tpoly create c user
# similarly for b (base), p (project), and w (workspace)
clojure -Tpoly create w next-gen top-ns com.my-company
# is shorthand for:
clojure -Tpoly create entity workspace name next-gen top-ns com.my-company
----

Finally, for some commands, more than one "entity" can be provided for the entity exec argument, those can be `:`-separated (in a string), or use `entities` and a vector (which can have symbols instead of strings):

[source,shell]
----
clojure -Tpoly help entity create:component
# equivalent to:
clojure -Tpoly help entities '[create component]'
----

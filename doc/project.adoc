= Project

There are two kinds of `projects` in Polylith: development and deployable.

*The xref:development.adoc[development] project*:

* Where you work with the code, often from a REPL.
* Described in `./deps.edn` which:
** Specifies all bricks and project libraries used by the project.
** Optionally defines xref:profile.adoc[profiles].
* Source code to support development (not part of any component or base) lives under the `./development` directory.

*A deployable project:*

* Used to build deployable xref:artifacts.adoc[artifacts], e.g., lambda functions, REST APIs, tools, etc.
* Has its own directory under the `./projects` directory (e.g., `my-project`), which:
** Has a `deps.edn` specifying the bricks and libraries used by the deployable project.
*** If the referenced bricks contain any tests, they are run when you execute the xref:commands.adoc#test[test] command.
** Can optionally have a `resources` directory.
** Can optionally have a `test` directory for project-specific tests.
** Doesn't have a `src` directory.
We discourage a `src` directory for deployable projects; all production code should normally only live in bricks.

The `:project` key in `./workspace.edn` configures project aliases and, optionally, how `poly` should run your xref:testing.adoc[tests].

Let's continue with our xref:introduction.adoc[tutorial].
The last thing you did was create a `cli` xref:base.adoc#create-component[base].
Run the following xref:commands#create-project[create project] command:

[source,shell]
----
poly create project name:command-line
----

Your workspace should now look like this:

[source,shell]

----
<1> new `command-line` project

[[project-alias]]
The `poly` tool helpfully reminds us:

[source,shell]
----
  It's recommended to add an alias to :projects in ./workspace.edn for the command-line project.
----

If you don't follow this advice, the `command-line` project heading will default to `?1` when running the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command.
Go ahead and add an alias in your `./workspace.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
  {...
   :projects {"development" {:alias "dev"}
              "command-line" {:alias "cl"}}} <1>
----
<1> Add the `cl` `alias` for the `command-line` project

Add the `user` component and the `cli` base to your new project by editing `projects/command-line/deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:deps {poly/user {:local/root "../../components/user"} ;; <1>
        poly/cli  {:local/root "../../bases/cli"} ;; <2>

        org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.12.0"}}
----
<1> Add `user` component
<2> Add `cli` base

****
The `:local/root` paths begin with `../../` because the `components` and `bases` directories are two levels up relative to `projects/command-line` directory.
****

When you run the xref:commands.adoc#test[test] command, `poly` will determine which tests should run.
If you want to run tests for each deployable project outside of `poly` using Clojure's tools.deps, you must specify the test paths in your `./deps.edn`.

[NOTE]
====
Each `./projects/**/deps.edn` specifies what bricks to include via `:local/root` dependencies.
The `poly` xref:commands.adoc[test] command determines the appropriate test dependencies from each referenced brick's `deps.edn`.

But Clojure's tools.deps does not include test dependencies from `:local/root` dependencies.
To support IDEs and other tooling, you must compensate by adding your brick tests as separate paths in your `./deps.edn`, just as you did for your xref:component.adoc#add-to-deps-edn[user component] and xref:base.adoc#add-to-deps-edn[cli base].
====

Where you specify dependency to bricks differs based on the project type:

* For the development project: `./deps.edn > :aliases > :dev > :extra-deps`
* For deployable projects: `./projects/PROJECT-DIR/deps.edn > :deps`

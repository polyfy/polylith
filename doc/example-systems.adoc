= Example Systems

If you are curious about what a full-blown system looks like in Polylith, look at the examples listed here.

TIP: The `info`, `deps`, and `libs` reports on this page were generated with xref:polyx.adoc[polyx] and its xref:commands.adoc#overview[overview] command.
We cover `polyx` and these reports later in the documentation.

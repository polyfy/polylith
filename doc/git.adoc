= Git

Here, we explore how `poly` works with https://git-scm.com/[git].

Let's continue with our xref:introduction.adoc[tutorial].
The last thing we did in our tutorial was xref:build.adoc[add build support].

We'll start with the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command.
We have had you run this command without explaining everything it outputs.
Rerun `info` to see the current state of your workspace:

[[info-all-changed-example]]
[source,shell]
----
poly info
----
image::images/git/info.png[width=400]

At the top, you'll notice `stable since: c91fdad` (your git short-SHA will differ from our `c91fdad`).
What does this mean?
Let's start from the beginning.

When you specify `:commit` when xref:workspace.adoc[creating a Polylith workspace], `poly` executes these git commands on your behalf:

[source,shell]
----
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Workspace created."
----

****
If you don't specify `:commit` for the xref:commands.adoc#create-workspace[create workspace] command, it is up to you to execute the above `git` commands (or the equivalent) manually.
****

Run `git log` from your `example` workspace root, and you'll see something like:

[source,shell]
----
commit c91fdad4a34927d9aacfe4b04ea2f304f3303282 (HEAD -> main)
Author: lisa <lisa@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 3 06:11:23 2020 +0200

    Workspace created.
----

This is the first and only commit for this git repository.
Notice that the commit hash matches the short-SHA from the `info` command output: `stable since: c91fdad`.
This first commit is considered the first _stable point in time_ for this workspace.

The `info` command calculates what has changed since the current _stable point in time_.

TIP: *Cursive users*:
If you followed our xref:development.adoc#cursive-enable-auto-add[setup instructions], Cursive will automatically add new files to the git repository.

If all files have not been added to git yet, add them now:

[source,shell]
----
git add --all
----

Look at the `info` command output again:

image::images/git/info.png[width=400]

Notice that `poly` has marked all projects (`command-line` and `development`) and all bricks (`user` and `cli`) with a trailing `*` (asterisk), meaning they have changed after the current _stable point in time_ (as described by `stable since: c91fdad`).

Let's dig into how `poly` determines this.
Run the xref:commands.adoc#diff[diff] command to see all files that have been added since the last commit:

[source,shell]
----
poly diff
----

You should see output like this:
// scripts/output/git-diff.txt
[source,shell]
----
bases/cli/deps.edn
bases/cli/resources/cli/.keep
bases/cli/src/se/example/cli/core.clj
bases/cli/test/se/example/cli/core_test.clj
build.clj
components/user/deps.edn
components/user/resources/user/.keep
components/user/src/se/example/user/core.clj
components/user/src/se/example/user/interface.clj
components/user/test/se/example/user/interface_test.clj
deps.edn
development/src/dev/lisa.clj
projects/command-line/deps.edn
workspace.edn
----

We expect you are starting to see how `poly` decides to mark items as changed with the `*` (asterisk):

|===
| The `poly` tool knows that there are changes in: | Because there are differences under dir:

| `command-line` project
| `projects/command-line/`

| `development` project
| `development/`

| `user` brick
| `component/user/`

| `cli` brick
| `bases/cli/`

|===

****
Internally, the `diff` command runs:

[source,shell]
----
git diff c91fdad4a34927d9aacfe4b04ea2f304f3303282 --name-only
----

If your xref:workspace.adoc#workspace-root-under-git-root[workspace root isn't the same as your git root], the `diff` command will internally strip away the workspace directory.

The workspace directory is available via `poly get:ws-local-dir` and will return `nil` if your workspace is at the git root.
****

When you created your xref:workspace.adoc[workspace], `poly` created a  https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore[.gitignore] for you.
Now is a good time to add more rules to `/.gitignore` if needed.

[[add-and-commit]]
Add and commit any new and changed files:

[source,shell]
----
git add --all
git commit -m "Created the user and cli bricks."
----

Have a look at our workspace repository commit history again:

[source,shell]
----
git log --pretty=oneline
----

Your git SHAs will be different, but you'll see something like:

[source,shell]
----
e7ebe683a775ec28b7c2b5d77e01e79d48149d13 (HEAD -> main) Created the user and cli bricks.
c91fdad4a34927d9aacfe4b04ea2f304f3303282 Workspace created.
----

If you rerun the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command, it will return the same result as before.
This is because you haven't moved your _stable point in time_ yet.
We'll dig into this in xref:tagging.adoc[Tagging].

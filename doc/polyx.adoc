= Polyx

Since version `0.2.18`, we have the new `polyx` tool which can do everything that `poly` can, plus create images from different commands.
One more difference is that it's not released as an AOT compiled, stand-alone tool, as `poly` is.

If you want to use `polyx`, then you need to add it as an alias to `./deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
:polyx {:main-opts ["-m" "polylith.clj.core.poly-cli.core"]
        :extra-deps {polyfy/polylith
                     {:git/url   "https://github.com/polyfy/polylith"
                      :sha       "155b55ab9e51ecd5ee0622a82a87468dac00bba3"
                      :deps/root "projects/polyx"}}}}}
----

If you want to use a stable version, then click on a release (`0.2.18` or later) in xref:https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/tags[tags].
Then select the first "Code" tab, and you will see that e.g. "v0.2.18" is selected as branch/version at the top left of the page.
Now click the "commits" link and copy the full sha for the top commit on the page (which is the latest commit).

If you want to use the latest SNAPSHOT version, copy the latest commit from the `master` branch instead.

Now let's start a shell, using the `polyx` tool, by executing this from the workspace root:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:polyx
----

Let's create an image by running the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command (which can also be done from the xref:commands.adoc#[deps] and xref:commands.adoc#libs[libs] commands):

[source,shell]
----
example$ info out:info.png
----

This will create the `info.png` image containing the output from the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command.
If the file ends with any of the file formats listed https://clojure2d.github.io/clojure2d/docs/codox/clojure2d.core.html#var-img-writer-formats[here] then an image will be created in the specified format.
It ends with something else, e.g. `.txt`, then a text file is created:

[source,shell]
----
poly info out:info.txt
----

This can be "printed" by executing `cat info.txt`:

image::images/polyx/output/info.png[width=400]

The color codes can be removed if we want:

[source,shell]

poly info out:info.txt color-mode:none

The `polyx` tool also includes the new xref:commands.adoc#overview[overview] command:

[source,shell]
----
example$ overview out:overview.png :no-changes
----

The generated image looks like this:

image::images/polyx/output/overview.png[]

This image can be used in our documentation to get an overview of the workspace.

====
NOTE: There are issues reported for Apple silicon when using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Window_Toolkit[Java AWT] (used by the underlying https://github.com/Clojure2D/clojure2d[clojure2d] library, to create the images) which is one of the reasons we don't include support for creating images in the `poly` tool.
Another source of trouble may be that `polyx` starts a Java process, which is not always desirable in a command line tool: +
image:images/polyx/java.png[]
====

[Caution]
====
CAUTION: The `polyx` tool may be converted to a custom command in the future, when we have support for that, and when that happens the `polyx` project may be deleted and configured in a different way.

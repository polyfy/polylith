Table Notes:
[[startup-time]]
. If you follow our recommendation of using the `poly` xref:shell.adoc[shell], startup time is not much of a concern.

We prefer to install `poly` as a stand-alone and/or as a Clojure CLI dep.
Your preference is fine too; there are no wrong choices.

:prerequisites: First, ensure that you have https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure CLI] and https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git] installed. +
If you are installing git for the first time, don't forget to configure your git https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git[user.name] and https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git[user.email].

:post-install: pass:n[You will soon create your first xref:workspace.adoc[workspace] - for now, only `version`, `help`, `doc`, and `create workspace` commands will work.]

[#install-on-mac]
== Install as Stand-alone on macOS

{prerequisites}

To install the `poly` tool on macOS, run:

[source,shell]
----
brew install polyfy/polylith/poly
----

The `poly` https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/build/resources/brew/exec[script] is now installed and added to the system path.
The script uses Java to launch the poly tool.

If you get an error such as "openjdk-13.0.2.jdk could not be opened...", try:

* Open MacOS `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General`.
* Click Allow at the bottom for `openjdk-13.0.2.jdk`.
* Run `brew install polyfy/polylith/poly` again.

Verify the installation by running `poly help`.

{post-install}

[#install-on-linux]
== Install as Stand-alone on Linux

{prerequisites}

To install the `poly` tool on Linux:

* Download the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases/latest[latest release] of the poly jar, e.g.: `poly-{poly-version}.jar`.
* Create a directory, e.g., `/usr/local/polylith`, and copy the jar file to that directory.
* Create a file `poly` under e.g., `/usr/local/bin` containing:
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
#!/bin/sh

ARGS=""
while [ "$1" != "" ] ; do
 ARGS="$ARGS $1"
 shift
done

exec "/usr/bin/java" $JVM_OPTS "-jar" "/usr/local/polylith/poly-{poly-version}.jar" $ARGS
----

* Make sure that:
** You are referencing the correct jar file.
** The path to `java` is correct (verify with `which java`).
* If you chose `/usr/local/bin`, it is probably already on your system path.
Otherwise, adjust your system path as necessary.
* Make `poly` executable via `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/poly` (adjust path as necessary).

Verify the installation by running `poly help`.

{post-install}

[#install-on-windows]
== Install Stand-alone on Windows

{prerequisites}

=== Troubleshooting Clojure CLI Install on Windows

TIP: If you are running on Windows, you might prefer to use the more user-friendly https://github.com/casselc/clj-msi[clj-msi].

TIP: Windows users should also consider using WSL and then follow instructions under <<install-on-linux>>.

If you have installed Clojure's Powershell module and see an error like:

[source,shell]
----
clj : The 'clj' command was found in the module 'ClojureTools', but the module could not be loaded.
For more information, run 'Import-Module ClojureTools'.
----

...and if you followed the instruction and executed this:

[source,shell]
----
Import-Module ClojureTools
----

...and got this error:

[source,shell]
----
Import-Module : File C:\Users\Admin\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ClojureTools\ClojureTools.psm1
cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information,
see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
----

...then try this:

[source,shell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
----

=== Install the poly tool

* Download the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases/latest[latest release] of the poly jar, e.g., `poly-{poly-version}.jar`.
* Create a `Polylith` directory, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Polylith`, and copy the poly jar file to that directory.
* In the same directory, create file `poly.bat` containing:
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
@echo off
start /wait /b java %JAVA_OPTS% -jar "C:\Program Files\Polylith\poly-poly-{poly-version}.jar" %*
----
Double-check that it references the correct poly jar.
* Add `C:\Program Files\Polylith` to the Windows `Path` environment variable.

Test the installation by typing `poly help` from the command line.

{post-install}

NOTE: The xref:colors.adoc[coloring] of text is not supported on Windows.

[#install-via-nix]
== Install as Stand-alone via Nix

{prerequisites}

The `poly` tool is installable from https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/tools/misc/polylith/default.nix[nixpkgs]:

[source,shell]
----
nix-shell -p polylith
# or
nix-env -iA 'nixos.polylith'
----

Test the installation by typing `poly help` from the command line.

{post-install}

[#use-as-dependency]
== Use as Dependency

An alternative way to run the `poly` tool is as a dependency from the `:poly` alias in your `./deps.edn` file.

{prerequisites}

After you have created a Polylith xref:workspace.adoc[workspace], you'll notice a `./deps.edn` file was automatically generated.
It includes a `:poly` alias.
It will look something like:

[source,clojure,subs="attributes+"]
----
 :aliases {:poly {:extra-deps {polylith/clj-poly {:mvn/version "{poly-version}"}}
                  :main-opts  ["-m" "polylith.clj.core.poly-cli.core"]}}
----

Feel free to adjust the `:mvn/version` to suit your needs.
For example, you might want to try out the latest `SNAPSHOT` version.

TIP: Docs for `SNAPSHOT` releases are also available on cljdoc.

Navigate to your newly created workspace directory and verify via `clojure -M:poly help`.

TIP: If you have no interest in using any stand-alone variant of `poly` and want to use `poly` only as a dependency, see xref:workspace.adoc#bootstrap[Bootstrapping a Workspace].

For more details on how `poly` is released, see docs on xref:polylith-ci-setup.adoc#releases[releases].

[#github-dependency]
=== Using a Git Dependency
If you wish, you can specify a git dep revision from the GitHub Polylith project.
To do so, you'd adjust your `./deps.edn` `:poly` alias to something like:

[source,clojure]
----
 :aliases {:poly {:extra-deps {polylith/clj-poly
                               {:git/url   "https://github.com/polyfy/polylith.git"
                                :sha       "INSERT-SHA-HERE"
                                :deps/root "projects/poly"}}
                  :main-opts  ["-m" "polylith.clj.core.poly-cli.core"]}}
----

Replace `INSERT-SHA-HERE` with a commit SHA from the Polylith repository, for example:

1. From the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/commits/master[latest commit] from the `master` branch.
(Alternatively, you can specify the latest `SNAPSHOT` release as a maven dependency)
2. Or some commit SHA from a work-in-progress branch you want to try

=== Specifying Logging Libraries
You can add in the logging libraries you'd like to use with `poly` by adjusting your `:poly` alias in your `./deps.edn` like so:

[source,clojure]
----
 :aliases {:poly {:extra-deps {polylith/clj-poly {:mvn/version "{poly-version}"}
                               ;; your logging libraries here:
                               org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-api {:mvn/version "2.20.0"}
                               org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-slf4j-impl {:mvn/version "2.20.0"}}
                  :main-opts  ["-m" "polylith.clj.core.poly-cli.core"]}}
----

[#install-as-clojure-cli-tool]
== Install as Stand-alone via Clojure CLI Tool

{prerequisites}

Clojure tools was introduced in https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure CLI] v1.10.3.933.
Upgrade to current if you are using an older version.

Installing `poly` as a Clojure Tool is not OS-specific.

To install `poly` as a tool:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
clojure -Ttools install io.github.polyfy/polylith '{:git/tag "v{poly-version}" :deps/root "projects/poly"}' :as poly
----

An alternative to specifying a `:git/tag` is to specify a `:git/sha`.
This allows you to install any git revision poly and is often used to test out a version that has not been officially released yet or is on some work-in-progress branch:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -Ttools install io.github.polyfy/polylith '{:git/sha "5f74c8b8675dbb091258165d327af3958716a247" :deps/root "projects/poly"}' :as poly
----

IMPORTANT: Do not use the `install-latest` option for `clojure -Ttools` as it does not support `:deps/root`.

Test the installation by typing `clojure -Tpoly help` from the command line.

{post-install}

=== Clojure Tool CLI Command Line Syntax

The command-line argument syntax for Clojure CLI tools uses an "exec args" format, essentially Clojure keyword/value pairs.

For this reason, it can be convenient to first launch a `poly` shell so you can use the conventional `poly` command-line argument syntax.
Let's say you want to get info on lines of code.

[source,shell]
----
clojure -Tpoly shell
----

After which you can specify standard Polylith arguments:
[source,text,subs="attributes+"]
----
                  _      _ + _   _
#####   _ __  ___| |_  _| |-| |_| |_
#####  | '_ \/ _ \ | || | | |  _| ' \
#####  | .__/\___/_|\_, |_|_|\__|_||_|
       |_|          |__/ poly {poly-version}
polylith$ info :loc
----

The tool "exec args" equivalent is:
[source,shell]
----
clojure -Tpoly info loc true
----

=== Clojure Tool CLI Tips

Installed versions of all Clojure tools can be listed with:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -Ttools list
----

[TIP]
====
`clojure` can often be replaced with the shorter `clj`:

[source,shell]
----
clj -Ttools list
----

But use `clojure` when launching a `poly` shell (see xref:tools-deps.adoc#clojure-vs-clj[clojure vs clj]):

[source,shell]
----
clojure -Tpoly shell
----
====

You can get basic built-in help via Clojure CLI's help machinery:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -A:deps -Tpoly help/doc
----

How to use the `poly` command as a Clojure tool is described in the xref:clojure-cli-tool.adoc[Clojure CLI Tool] section.
The official documentation for Clojure tools is https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli#tool_install[here].

== Use as a library
[#use-as-a-library]

The `poly` functionality can also be accessed as a library.
The API is documented link:{cljdoc-api-url}/polylith[here].

[#jvm-options]
== JVM options
You might want to specify more RAM to the `poly` tool and/or where the configuration file for logging is located.
These can be conveyed via the `JVM_OPTS` environment variable which `poly` will passes along to the Java runtime at launch of poly stand-alone.

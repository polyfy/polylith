### Doc updates
- Changed the sha for Sean's External test runner to `c97747aa2b1fdf03c46c7e435cca7c2608740a2a` in [this](https://cljdoc.org/d/polylith/clj-poly/0.3.0/doc/test-runners#_use_a_custom_test_runner) section.
  This version ignores cljs namespaces, which would otherwise have caused errors when running the `test` command.

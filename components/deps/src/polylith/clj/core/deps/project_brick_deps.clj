   are stored in a map with a :src and :test key and includes a key for each brick that is included
   in the project, together with the direct, indirect, and circular dependencies (if any) +
   missing dependencies on interfaces and bases (if any).

   A project can only have one component per interface (one implementation) and we take advantage of this by
   translating all component names to their interface names when calculating the dependencies for a project.
   The bases are already unique (a base is not allowed to have the same name as an interface and vice versa)
   so we mix interface and base names and call them brick-ids, when calculating the brick-id->deps atom/map.

   We only keep track on dependencies at the brick level, not the namespace level. This means we are stricter
   than the compiler, and that we consider dependencies like A > B > A or A > B > C > A as circular dependencies,
   even in those cases where the code compiles.

   The src context of a brick can only depend on other brick's src context, never their test context (because it's
   not available). A brick's test context often only depends on other component's src context, but it's also allowed
   to depend on their test context.

   To get the dependency calculations right, we split the keys in brick-id->brick-ids into src and test keys,
   so that e.g. 'util' will get the name 'util' for the src context and 'util (t)' for the test context.

   A project can have a different set of components for src and test (e.g. a test-helper only used in test)
   and their dependency graph may also differ. This is why it's important to have keys for both the src and test
   context. If the test context depends on its own src context, then it will also include the dependencies
   from the src context (we never store dependencies on ourselves in the dependency graph).

   If a brick is only included in the test context of a project, then all its dependencies will be treated as test
   dependencies (the src dependencies will be merged into the test dependencies and then set as empty).

   In workspace.edn under the :projects key, it's possible to specify which bricks to include or exclude for a
   project. This can be useful if we e.g. only want to run tests for one of our projects (it's passed in as
   bricks-to-test). In this example we can specify :test to [] or {:include []} for all our projects except for one.

   When all dependencies are calculated, we need to pass in bricks-to-test to brick-deps to make sure we don't
   treat bricks that are excluded from testing, as missing.

   One more thing to remember. Bricks are normally included in a project using the :local/root syntax,
   and in that case we will inherit the brick's :src and :test context from each brick. The :paths and
   :aliases > :test > :extra-paths syntax is only needed for the development project if your IDE doesn't support
   the :local/root syntax.
   The recommendation is to use the :local/root syntax in all your projects if it's supported by your IDE."

== Welcome to the wonderful world of Polylith for Clojure and ClojureScript!

Polylith is made by developers for developers.
Our main goals are to decrease complexity, maximize productivity, and make coding a more joyful experience.
Although Polylith is not a build tool, it integrates into your build pipeline.

We recommend reading on, but if you're impatient, jump straight to the {cljdoc-doc-url}/introduction[introduction] of this _poly_ tool.

The documentation you are reading now describes the _poly_ command line tool, built for https://clojure.org/[Clojure] and https://clojurescript.org[ClojureScript].
Clojure is a powerful and simple functional language for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine[JVM], and ClojureScript is its JavaScript-targeting dialect.

Polylith introduces the architectural concept of “service level building blocks” which can be combined like LEGO® bricks to build our services and systems.
Polylith’s LEGO-like bricks are easy to reason about, test, refactor, and reuse.
They allow us to work with all our code in one place for maximum productivity, from a single https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop[REPL].

We can easily assemble our Polylith bricks into different kinds of deployable artifacts, like services and tools, in the same way we put together LEGO® when we were kids!
Not surprisingly, it's just as simple and fun!

To better understand the principles and ideas behind this tool, we recommend you first read about https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith[Polylith as a concept].
At the very least, read https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/introduction/polylith-in-a-nutshell[Polylith in a Nutshell], where concepts like interface, component, base, brick, project, and workspace are introduced.

You can then dig into the Clojure Polylith tool {cljdoc-doc-url}/introduction[introduction].

Enjoy the ride!

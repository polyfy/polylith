== Welcome to the wonderful world of Polylith for Clojure!

NOTE: *Work in Progress*: While we are very proud of our documentation, we are currently working to make it even better!
To give you a sneak peek, we built this `{snapshot-version}` release from our https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/tree/master[master] branch.

Polylith is made by developers for developers.
Our goal is to maximize productivity and increase the quality of the systems we create.
Although Polylith is not a build tool, it integrates into your build pipeline.

Polylith, as a concept, is documented https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith[here].

The documentation you are reading now describes the Polylith tool built for https://clojure.org/[Clojure], a powerful and simple functional language for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine[JVM].

Polylith introduces the architectural concept of “service level building blocks” which can be combined like LEGO® bricks to build our services and systems.
Polylith’s LEGO-like bricks are easy to reason about, test, refactor, and reuse.
They allow us to work with all our code in one place for maximum productivity, from a single https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop[REPL].

We can easily assemble our Polylith bricks into different kinds of deployable artifacts, like services and tools, in the same way we put together LEGO® when we were kids!
Not surprisingly, it's just as simple and fun!

To better understand the principles and ideas behind this tool, we recommend you first read about https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith[Polylith as a concept].
At the very least, read https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/introduction/polylith-in-a-nutshell[Polylith in a Nutshell], where concepts like interface, component, base, brick, project, and workspace are introduced.

You can then dig into the Clojure Polylith tool {cljdoc-doc-url}/introduction[introduction].

Enjoy the ride!

 Issue  Description
 -----  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  187   Support for more than one interface. Always accept 'interface' and 'ifc' + what's specified in :interface-ns.
  205   The new polyx tool has been added that allow us to generate images from command's output. It includes all
        functionality in 'poly' plus the overview command that generates the info/deb/libs image.
  249   Include bases in the circular dependency check (error 104).
  259   Added error 111 'Unreadable namespace in brick/project' + support for excluding files to parse,
        see 'poly help check' (error 111) for details.
  264   Improved error messages for workspace.edn and deps.edn config files (we now use clojure.edn when reading edn files).
  271   Option to display inverted deps grid, by swapping the x and y axes.
  272   The check command now also checks test dependencies (solved by issue 293 and 274).
  274   Support exclusion of bricks to test so that we support both :include and :exclude for projects in workspace.edn.
  277   Improved warning 205 by also showing non-top namespace files. Error 106 and 108 are not displayed in some edge cases.
  279   Trigger error 111 if a source file doesn't have a namespace.
  282   The check/info/test commands now report unnecessary components (warning 207). If a component is not referred
        to but still needed, it can be marked as :necessary by that project, see 'poly help check' (warning 207) for details.
  286   Make switch-ws available in the shell, outside a workspace.
  289   Make it possible to show all available options in a shell.
  290   Don't allow :commit when creating a workspace within an existing repo.
  293   Handle bases that depend on other bases correctly.
  294   Support for showing outdated libraries by passing in :outdated to the libs command.
  304   Update outdated examples/docs (solved by 312).
  305   Recognise test-resources as a resources directory.
  309   Improve the performance of the poly commands by optimising the dependency calculations.
  312   Build docs/example code should not use build-clj.
  313   NPE when importing Java sub namespace.
  316   Don't validate data_readers.clj files.
  318   Use cljdoc for the poly tool documentation. Moved back all the poly tool documentation to the GitHib repository
        together with the source code + updated the documentation + added new pages:
        Artifacts, Doc, Tap, Test Runners, Validations, Source code, Polylith CI setup, Polyx, and Versions.
        The new 'doc' command was added, giving us easy access all web based, Polylith related documentation.
  376   Support updating all libraries to the latest version, by using 'poly libs :update'.

Other improvements
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Exclude license files when building an uberjar.
 - We no longer include tools.deps as a library when creating projects.
 - Removed the :all option for the deps and libs commands, so that we no longer include bricks that don't have a lib dep.
 - Also include missing bases in validation error 107.
 - A shell can be started using 'poly :tap' which is equivalent to 'poly shell :tap'. This will start a shell
   and open up a portal window at the same time. Other valid first parameters: :all, :fake-poly, :github, :local, :ws-file, and :ws-dir.
 - The portal window now only includes the workspace structure, which makes it an alternative way to browse the workspace.
 - In the deps command, we now exclude empty columns (bricks that don't use any library).
 - If we use switch-ws in a shell and execute a command and give the color-mode, then it will be used by that command.
 - The autocomplete now works when starting a shell outside a workspace, which can be useful when creating a workspace,
   or if we want to switch to another workspace.
 - The test that executed 'libs :outdated' has been removed, so that it doesn't fail intermittently. Earlier, the tests for
   a PR could suddenly start failing if a newer version of a used library was released.
 - If we switch to a file using e.g. 'switch-ws file:ws.edn', the :no-changes will now work properly.
 - Removed support for running `poly` as a Clojure Tool.
 - Show size as dash (- instead of 0) in the libs command, if a library hasn't been downloaded yet. This stopped working in 0.2.17-alpha.
 - Handle spacing between bricks correctly in the libs command when passing in skip:dev.

  Starts an interactive shell with the name of the selected workspace, e.g.:
    myworkspace$>

  poly [shell] [:all] [:tap]

    :all = The autocomplete will suggest all available arguments,
           including rarely used ones.

    :tap = A Portal window that outputs tap> statements is opened.

  From here we can execute any poly command, e.g.:
    myworkspace$> info

  We can also use the built in autocomplete, e.g.:
    myworkspace$> i

  ...and when pressing the <tab> key, the 'i' is completed to 'info'.

  This works for both commands and arguments, and is context sensitive.
  If we for example type:
    myworkspace$> deps brick:mybrick project:

  ...and press <tab>, it will only suggest projects that include 'mybrick'.

  Arguments that start with a : can be selected by just typing their name,
  e.g. 'l' will select ':loc'. To distinguish between 'project:PROJECT' and
  ':project' we need to type ':p' to select ':project'.

  From the shell we also have access to these commands:
    switch-ws ARG  Switches to selected workspace.
    tap [ARG]      Opens (or closes/cleans) a portal window that outputs tap>
                   statements.
    exit           Exits the shell.
    quit           Quits the shell.

  It's also possible to start a shell and switch to a workspace at the same time,
  e.g.:
    poly shell ws-dir:examples/doc-example
    poly shell ws-file:realworld.edn

  An alternative way of exiting the shell is by pressing <ctrl>+C or <ctrl>+D.

  Example:
    poly shell
    poly shell :all
    poly shell :tap
    poly shell :all :tap
    poly doc page:shell

  Migrates a workspace to the latest version.

  poly migrate

  If the workspace hasn't been migrated already, then this command will create a new
  ./workspace.edn file + a deps.edn file per brick. All project deps.edn files will be
   updated. The libraries in each project's deps.edn file will be sorted, so it can be
   an idea to manually change that order and put bricks first followed by the libraries.

  The migration tool will use the :ns-to-lib key to figure out what libraries are
  used in each brick. After the migration, it's recommended to go through all the
  bricks and make sure that all libraries it uses are also specified in each brick's
  deps.edn file.

  Continue by updating each project's deps.edn file and remove libraries that are
  already indirectly included by bricks (via :local/root).
  The paths in ./deps.edn is left untouched and the reason is that the :local/root
  syntax is not supported by all IDE's.

  Starting from version 0.2.0-alpha10, the tool supports specifying dependencies per
  brick in its own deps.edn files. Workspace specific config is stored in ./workspace.edn
  instead of the :polylith key in ./deps which was the case prior to this version.

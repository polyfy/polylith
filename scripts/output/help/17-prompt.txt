  poly prompt

  Starts a prompt with the name of the current workspace, e.g.:
    myworkspace$>

  From here we are free to execute any command we want, e.g.:
    myworkspace$> info

  The idea is to get get rid of the startup time of the command
  and get instant feedback.

  Exit the interactive mode by typing 'exit' or 'quit'.

  Executes brick and/or project tests.

  poly test [ARGS]

  The brick tests are executed from all projects they belong to except for the development
  project (if not :dev is passed in):

  ARGS              Tests to execute
  ----------------  -------------------------------------------------------------
  (empty)           All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed.

  :project          All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed +
                    tests for changed projects.

  :all-bricks       All brick tests.

  :all              All brick tests + all project tests (except development).


  To execute the brick tests from the development project, also pass in :dev:

  ARGS              Tests to execute
  ----------------  -------------------------------------------------------------
  :dev              All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed,
                    executed from all projects (development included).

  :project :dev     All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed,
                    executed from all projects (development included) +
                    tests for changed projects (development included).

  :all-bricks :dev  All brick tests, executed from all projects
                    (development included).

  :all :dev         All brick tests, executed from all projects
                    (development included) + all project tests
                    (development included).

  Projects can also be explicitly selected with e.g. project:proj1 or
  project:proj1:proj2.

  We can also specify which bricks to include, by listing them like this:
  brick:mycomponent:another-component:mybase

  Example:
    poly test
    poly test :project
    poly test :all-bricks
    poly test :all
    poly test project:proj1
    poly test project:proj1:proj2
    poly test brick:mycomponent
    poly test brick:mycomponent:mybase
    poly test :dev
    poly test :project :dev
    poly test :all-bricks :dev
    poly test :all :dev

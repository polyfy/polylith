  Shows the output from the info, deps, and libs commands, side by side.
  This command is mainly used to generate an image for your documentation.

  poly overview [:no-changes] [out:FILENAME]
    (omitted)   = Shows the output.
    :no-changes = Shows the output as if there were no changes in the workspace.
    out         = Creates a text or image file based on the output.
                  If FILENAME ends with .txt, then the file will contain
                  the output as text. If FILENAME ends with .bmp, .wbmp, .gif,
                  .png, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, or .tiff, then the file will be
                  generated as an image.

  Example:
    poly overview
    poly overview out:overview.png
    poly overview out:overview.jpg :no-changes

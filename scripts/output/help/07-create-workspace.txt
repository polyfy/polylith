  Creates a workspace in current directory. If the workspace is created within
  an existing git repo, then that repository will be used. If the workspace is
  created outside a git repo, and the :create flag is passed in, then a new repo
  will be initiated using the 'main' branch, if another branch is not explicitly
  given. In both cases, all the created files and directories will be committed
  to the repo in a single commit with the text 'Workspace created.'.

  If :commit is not passed in, then the repository needs to be initiated manually
  with statements similar to this:
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Workspace created."

  poly create workspace [name:NAME] top-ns:TOP-NAMESPACE [:commit] [branch:BRANCH]
    NAME = The name of the workspace to create, which must be given
           if created outside a git repository. Otherwise it's optional.

    TOP-NAMESPACE = The top namespace, e.g. com.my.company.

    BRANCH = The name of the branch, e.g. master. Default is main.

  Example:
    poly create w name:myws top-ns:com.my.company
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company :commit
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company branch:master

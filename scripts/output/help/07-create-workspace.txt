  Creates a workspace in current directory. If the workspace is created within
  an existing git repo, then that repository will be used. If the workspace is
  created outside a git repo, then you have two alternatives:

  1. Pass in :commit and let the tool initiate the repository and commit the files
     for you, using these commands:
       git init
       git add .
       git commit -m "Workspace created."

  2. Initiate the workspace manually by executing commands similar to the ones above.

  poly create workspace [name:NAME] top-ns:TOP-NAMESPACE [:commit] [branch:BRANCH]
    NAME = The name of the workspace to create, which must be given
           if created outside a git repository. Otherwise it's optional.

    TOP-NAMESPACE = The top namespace name.

    BRANCH = The name of the branch, or main if not given.

  Example:
    poly create w name:myws top-ns:com.my.company :commit
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company :commit
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company branch:master :commit

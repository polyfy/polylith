  poly [shell] [:tap]

  Starts an interactive shell with the name of the selected workspace, e.g.:
    myworkspace$>

  If :tap is passed in, a portal window that outputs tap> statements is opened.

  From here we can execute any poly command, e.g.:
    myworkspace$> info

  We can also use the built in autocomplete, e.g.:
    myworkspace$> i

  ...and when pressing the <tab> key, the 'i' is completed to 'info'.

  This works for both commands and arguments, and is context sensitive.
  If we for example type:
    myworkspace$> deps brick:mybrick project:

  ...and press <tab>, it will only suggest projects that include 'mybrick'.

  Parameters that start with a : can be selected by just typing their name,
  e.g. 'l' will select ':loc'. To distinguish between 'project:PROJECT' and
  ':project' we need to type ':p' to select ':project'.

  From the shell we also have access to these commands:
    switch-ws ARG  Switches to selected workspace.
    tap [ARG]      Opens (or closes/cleans) a portal window that outputs tap> statements.
    exit           Exits the shell.
    quit           Quits the shell.

  An alternative way of exiting the shell is by pressing <ctrl>+C or <ctrl>+D.

  Starts an interactive shell with the name of the selected workspace, e.g.:
    myworkspace$>

  poly [shell] [:tap] [:all]

  If :tap is passed in, a Portal window that outputs tap> statements is opened.

  From here we can execute any poly command, e.g.:
    myworkspace$> info

  We can also use the built in autocomplete, e.g.:
    myworkspace$> i

  ...and when pressing the <tab> key, the 'i' is completed to 'info'.

  This works for both commands and arguments, and is context sensitive.
  If we for example type:
    myworkspace$> deps brick:mybrick project:

  ...and press <tab>, it will only suggest projects that include 'mybrick'.

  Parameters that start with a : can be selected by just typing their name,
  e.g. 'l' will select ':loc'. To distinguish between 'project:PROJECT' and
  ':project' we need to type ':p' to select ':project'.

  If :all is passed in, the autocomplete will suggest all available parameters,
  including rarely used ones and those that are only useful for maintainers of
  the poly tool itself.

  From the shell we also have access to these commands:
    switch-ws ARG  Switches to selected workspace.
    tap [ARG]      Opens (or closes/cleans) a portal window that outputs tap> statements.
    exit           Exits the shell.
    quit           Quits the shell.

  An alternative way of exiting the shell is by pressing <ctrl>+C or <ctrl>+D.

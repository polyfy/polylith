  When the project is known, we also know which components are used.

  In this example, payer uses user in the src context, and util only
  in the test context. user uses util, and cli uses payer. The 't'
  means that payer is only used in the test context by user. The +
  signs mark indirect dependencies, while - signs (not present here)
  mark indirect dependencies in the test context. Here the cli base
  depends on user and util, via 'cli > payer > user' and
  'cli > payer > util'. Each usage comes from at least one :require
  statement in the brick.

  Example:
    poly deps project:myproject

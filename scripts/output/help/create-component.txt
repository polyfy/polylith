  poly create component name:NAME [interface:INTERFACE] [dialect:DIALECT] [:git-add]

    NAME = The name of the component to create.

    DIALECT = The value is sent to Selmer when the component is created.
              If 'cljs' is provided, a 'package.json' file is also created.
              Valid values are: clj, cljs

    :git-add = If :vcs > :auto-add in workspace.edn is set to false,
               then we can pass in this flag instead, to explicitly add the
               created files to git.

    INTERFACE = The name of the interface (namespace) or NAME if not given.

  Example:
    poly create component name:user
    poly create component name:user dialect:cljs
    poly create component name:user :git-add
    poly create component name:admin interface:user

  poly 0.3.32 (2025-12-29) - https://github.com/polyfy/polylith

  poly CMD [ARGS] - where CMD [ARGS] are:

    check [ARG]                 Checks if the workspace is valid.
    create E name:N [ARG]       Creates a component, base, project or workspace.
    deps [project:P] [brick:B]  Shows dependencies.
    diff [ARG]                  Shows changed files since last stable point in time.
    doc [ARG]                   Opens the web based documentation in a browser.
    help [C] [ARG]              Shows this help or help for specified command.
    info [ARGS]                 Shows a workspace overview and checks if it's valid.
    libs [ARGS]                 Shows all libraries in the workspace.
    shell [ARGS]                Starts an interactive shell.
    test [ARGS]                 Runs tests.
    version                     Shows current version of the tool.
    ws [get:X]                  Shows the workspace as data.

  From the shell:

    switch-ws ARG  Switches to specified workspace.
    tap [ARG]      Opens a portal window that outputs tap> statements.
    exit           Exits the shell.
    quit           Quits the shell.

  If ws-dir:PATH is passed in as an argument, where PATH is a relative
  or absolute path, then the command is executed from that directory.
  This works for all commands except 'test'.

  If ws-file:FILE is passed in, then the workspace will be populated with the content
  from that file. All commands except 'create' and 'test' can be executed with this
  argument set. The FILE is created by executing the 'ws' command, e.g.:
  'poly ws out:ws.edn'.

  The ws-dir and ws-file arguments are replaced by switch-ws when executing commands
  from the shell.

  If skip:PROJECTS is passed in, then the given project(s) will not be read from disk.
  Both project names and aliases can be used and should be separated by : if more than
  one.

  If since:SINCE is passed in as an argument, the last stable point in time will be
  used depending on the value of SINCE (or the first commit if no match was found).
  If prefixed with 'previous-', e.g. 'previous-release', then the SHA directly before
  the most recent matching tag of the 'release' pattern will be used:
    stable  -> the latest tag that matches ^stable-*, defined by
               :tag-patterns > :stable in workspace.edn.
    release -> the latest tag that matches ^v[0-9]*, defined by
               :tag-patterns > :release in workspace.edn.
    KEY     -> any key in :tag-patterns.
    SHA     -> a git SHA-1 hash (if no key was found in :tag-patterns).

  The color mode is taken from ~/.config/polylith/config.edn but can be overridden by
  passing in color-mode:COLOR where valid colors are none, light, and dark.
  (if the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is set, that will be used instead of
  ~/.config)

  Example (shell only):
    switch-ws dir:~/myworkspace
    switch-ws file:../../another/ws.edn
    switch-ws via:myworkspace
    tap
    tap open
    tap clean
    tap close

  'poly :tap' will start a shell and open a portal window.

  Example:
    poly
    poly :tap
    poly check
    poly check :dev

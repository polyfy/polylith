  Migrates a workspace to the latest version.

  poly migrate [config-filename:FILENAME]

    FILENAME = The name of the file that stores configuration for projects and bricks.
               If not given, config.edn will be used.

  As of version 0.2.19, bases, components, and projects store their configuration in config.edn files.
  This command will move configuration from the :bricks and :projects keys in workspace.edn
  to corresponding config.edn files.

  Example:
    poly migrate
    poly migrate config-filename:entity.edn

  Selects which workspace to be used by commands executed from the shell.
  This replaces the use of ws-dir:DIR and ws-file:FILE, which will be appended
  automatically when executing commands, if dir:DIR or file:FILE is given.

  switch-ws ARG
    ARG = dir:DIR    Switches to the selected workspace directory.
                     The prompt will be prefixed with 'dir:' to show this.
          file:FILE  Switches to the workspace specified in the selected file,
                     created by something like 'poly ws out:ws.edn'.
                     The prompt will be prefixed with 'file:' to show this.

  Example:
    switch-ws dir:~/myworkspace
    switch-ws file:../../another/ws.edn

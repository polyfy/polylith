  Shows changed files since the most recent stable point in time.

  poly diff

  Internally, it executes 'git diff SHA --name-only' where SHA is the SHA-1
  of the first commit in the repository, or the SHA-1 of the most recent tag
  that matches the default pattern 'stable-*'.

  Stable points are normally set by the CI server or by individual developers,
  e.g. Lisa, with 'git tag -f stable-lisa'.

  The pattern can be changed in :tag-patterns in workspace.edn.

  The way the latest tag is found is by taking the first line that matches the 'stable-*'
  regular expression, or if no match was found, the first commit in the repository.
    git log --pretty=format:'%H %d'

  Here is a compact way of listing all the commits including tags:
    git log --pretty=oneline

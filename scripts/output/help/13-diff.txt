  Shows changed files since the most recent stable point in time.

  poly diff [ARG]

  If since:SINCE is passed in as an argument, the last stable point in time will be
  used depending on the value of SINCE (or the first commit if no match was found).
  If prefixed with 'previous-', e.g. 'previous-release', then the SHA directly before
  the most recent matching tag of the 'release' pattern will be used:
    stable  -> the latest tag that matches stable-*, defined by
               :tag-patterns > :stable in workspace.edn.
    release -> the latest tag that matches v[0-9]*, defined by
               :tag-patterns > :release in workspace.edn.
    KEY     -> any key in :tag-patterns.
    SHA     -> a git SHA-1 hash (if no key was found in :tag-patterns).

  Internally, it executes 'git diff SHA --name-only' where SHA is the SHA-1
  of the first commit in the repository, or the SHA-1 of the most recent tag
  that matches the default pattern 'stable-*' or the passed in since:SINCE.

  Stable points are normally set by the CI server or by individual developers,
  e.g. Lisa, with 'git tag -f stable-lisa'.

  The pattern can be changed in :tag-patterns in workspace.edn.

  The way the latest tag is found is by taking the first line that matches the 'stable-*'
  regular expression, or if no match was found, the first commit in the repository.
    git log --pretty=format:'%H %d'

  Here is a compact way of listing all the commits including tags:
    git log --pretty=oneline

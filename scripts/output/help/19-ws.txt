  Prints or writes the workspace as data.

  poly ws [get:ARG] [out:FILE] [:latest-sha] [branch:BRANCH]
    ARG = keys  -> Lists the keys for the data structure:
                   - If it's a hash map, it returns all its keys.
                   - If it's a list and its elements are hash maps,
                     it returns a list with all the :name keys.

          count -> Counts the number of elements.

          KEY   -> If applied to a hash map, it returns the value of the KEY.
                   If applied to a list of hash maps, it returns the hash map with
                   a matching :name. Projects are also matched against :alias.

          INDEX -> A list element can be looked up by INDEX.

          Several ARG keys can be given, separated by colon.
          Every new key goes one level deeper into the workspace data structure.

    FILE = Writes the output to the specified FILE. Will have the same effect
           as setting color-mode:none and piping the output to a file.

    :latest-sha = if passed in, then settings:vcs:polylith:latest-sha will be set.
                  If A branch is given, e.g., branch:master, then the latest sha will be
                  retrieved from that branch.

  Example:
    poly ws
    poly ws get:keys
    poly ws get:count
    poly ws get:settings
    poly ws get:user-input:args
    poly ws get:user-input:args:0
    poly ws get:settings:keys
    poly ws get:components:keys
    poly ws get:components:count
    poly ws get:components:mycomp:lines-of-code
    poly ws get:settings:vcs:polylith :latest-sha
    poly ws get:settings:vcs:polylith :latest-sha branch:master
    poly ws out:ws.edn
    poly ws color-mode:none > ws.edn

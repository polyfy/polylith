  Selects which workspace to be used by commands executed from the shell.
  After we have switched workspace, all subsequent commands will append either
  ws-dir:DIR or ws-file:FILE, depending on whether we switch to a directory or a file.

  switch-ws [dir:DIR] [file:FILE] [via:SHORTCUT]

    DIR = Switches to the given workspace directory.
          The prompt will be prefixed with 'dir:' to show this.

    FILE = Switches to the workspace specified in the selected file,
           created by something like 'poly ws out:ws.edn'.
           The prompt will be prefixed with 'file:' to show this.

    SHORTCUT = Switches to the workspace specified under the :ws-shortcuts key in
               ~/.config/polylith/config.edn

    Example of a config file in ~/.config/polylith/config.edn:
    

  Example:
    switch-ws dir:~/myworkspace
    switch-ws file:../../another/ws.edn
    switch-ws via:myworkspace
